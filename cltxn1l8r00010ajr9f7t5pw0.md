## **What is Spheron Network?**

[**Spheron Network**](https://spheron.network/) is a Web3 infrastructure platform that provides tools and services to decentralize cloud storage and computing. It allows audited data centers to join the Spheron marketplace. Spheron oversees the decentralized and governed nature of the infrastructure, ensuring permissionless access and heightened security for all users. **Spheron Compute offers a feature-rich alternative to traditional cloud services at only one-third of the cost.**

Spheron offers a [**Compute Marketplace**](https://docs.spheron.network/marketplace-guide), which allows users to set up valuable tools quickly and easily, whether they want to deploy databases, nodes, tools, or AI. With Spheron, you don't have to worry about the technical stuff, and you can focus on deploying your Node with ease. Spheron Network has also partnered with organizations like [**Shardeum**](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-and-stake-a-shardeum-validator-on-spheron-in-minutes), [**Avail**](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-an-avail-node-in-minutes-using-spheron-compute), [**Elixir**](https://blog.spheron.network/step-by-step-guide-to-launching-an-elixir-node-with-spheron), [**Filecoin**](https://filecoin.io/), [**Arbitrum**](https://arbitrum.io/), etc, to redefine access to it and promote a more decentralized, inclusive, and community-centric ecosystem.

**Spheron provides features such as Private images, Auto-scale instances, Scale on demand, Real-time instance metrics, Faster GPUs, Free Bandwidths, Terraform Providers and SDKs, Instance health checks, activity, shell access, and more. Spheron provides add-on storage solutions for long-term data storage and edge bandwidth acceleration through its global CDN. With Spheron**[**,**](https://filecoin.io/)**you can easily set up your nodes in just a few minutes and enjoy low maintenance and operations costs and a great developer experience.**

## What is Fuel Network

[Fuel](https://fuel.network/) is an operating system purpose-built for Ethereum rollups. Its unique architecture allows rollups to solve for PSI (parallelization, state minimized execution, interoperability). Powered by the FuelVM, Fuel aims to expand Ethereum's capability without compromising security or decentralization.

### **Step 3: Deploying a Fuel Node With Spheron Platform UI**

Follow these steps to deploy a Fuel Node:

1\. Choose **"Compute"** to use CPU-based instances for running containers.

2\. Choose your desired Compute Type option under Compute Type.

**NOTE:** Please schedule a team call to gain early access to the **"Spot"** Type.

4\. **Select Region:** Select your preferred region for deployment. Choosing a region closer to you can improve performance and reduce latency.

5\. Next, Choose an instance plan that aligns with your requirements. Spheron will recommend a suitable plan according to the Fuel template, but you can customize it from available plans or choose to **'Create Custom Plans.'**

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/h2cvR9WmlUnBaZ43qhdMut4IBcNXWcE1XIVyCdSEc9RyCaHQM_CuUm1e1yPwEocUwwD4aC_FhaULCRZJffjgcBY-mbNH6zwJfoqtdgfIa5pCZfh0p_Gez22bFgLR5_RqqUjNj9MzEVrhVwm8f4ScfsU align="left")

6\. Next, Configure storage:You have to choose storage from the available options or the custom storage option that fits your needs. This storage will be volatile and is erased when the instance is restarted, redeployed, or shut down. Additionally, you get the option to choose Persistent Storage.

7.  Next, go to the configuration. In the ‘**Template Configuration’** section, you will need to add **‘Service Name’**; for example, we will write ‘NewNodeSpheron’ in it. and add **SEPOLIA RPC ENDPOINT.**

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-Rqqog91syYNq34EkZ6VI0PkrkKZ87dUsiYw7tReRcbi4Q1AL-m3Y5UzZ5ApwR-QWOnD_RenBAwQ1IJjOrfwSqx1oHrWuo_w--EFfeG2DJgJD89zXd5adxX1yuBGuGkcpuslNRRVPyf25aS5BMPrIj8 align="left")

### Step 4: Get SEPOLIA RPC ENDPOINT

1\. Go to [alchemy.com](https://www.alchemy.com/), Sign Up with your email ID, and set up your account.

2.  Go to [https://dashboard.alchemy.com/](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/) and click **‘Apps’** on the second option on the left.

3\. Click on ‘create new app’. You will get a pop-up screen where you have to choose **chain as 'Ethereum'** and **Network as ‘Ethereum Sepolia’**. Give Name and Description of the app and click **‘create app’**.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iKDH54DI9qXOwGXehS3s1YrZXbCWu0bwYnXaRjP6Db-sQKIE48BNcKtyNkzme73r-XDg5CSH98LkQxzEsrUfClj8hu_3UoSfjpOO7YlBtK7CGnkHSklztgkjQ_kogdexE8RbBTLgyYSzKV7pErsLvDE align="left")

4\. Next, On the right side of the screen, you will see the **‘API Key’** Button. Click on it and copy **the HTTPS link** from the pop-up window.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/c2Vst9ch3LRFAJqBWcpZcMqOu5pWy2MzxHxIJZEq8zaJjgaJ7mqm5SG9_zbDeIzXh9oFN1ivOkhGFgBIZ3bvNCiVYm0e6CgxUIfaeuLzZRBTIi3lLHUWXcgq1_nUyypNeyYxEuWD0-7t_F-7LIbhU5A align="left")

5\. Next, go back to the Spheron template configuration and paste the HTTPS link in the **‘SEPOLIA RPC ENDPOINT.’**

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/neaocceH6qZhzMIVEtuJBwV7sEa-3Gx8MIR-v1qUCC1svXC5-gDwWs103XUbs_73ErWJ6n1-1B22xz3vUPa5XLf62JycJoVjqqa-3RcXtV-ZDQO9d0nKgoYgdj3XbizpcESpXGpIhblTFdtib2-A9lA align="left")

6\. Click the **"Deploy"** button to deploy the node successfully.

Wait for your node to be fully set up. After it's provisioned, you'll see an option called **‘Shell Command’** on the left side of the dashboard; click on it.

### Step 5: Creating & Getting Fuel Wallet

1\. Go to the **‘Shell Command’** section on the left side of the dashboard, click on it, and Follow the step-by-step Fuel Wallet Commands to create a wallet.

```javascript
cd /root/.fuelup/bin
```

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/L2-HGpOtA66uh27T6vC5qx5iZNnJA9Z6M70kQqn_mcCSfKJv0A7O6KjTJkBQyHcQmptr48r15tU4rdNnuFiACs6ZewBdOS-9H5PougD-Un2Lo6omoouAzgYPAu2VK0K8_KjE-FjCOR0nnI6332EXq74 align="left")

2\. This will show the current fuelup version.

```javascript
./fuelup --version
```

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-S-rI79P57jtBQgK6CseloB6TdeK_p7EAndAtrm5qDDdMYCYKYNJ-PPm1n6w-ULGonn4cpnXnyXqTxntHciuEyDRxbe9afYMy6wGKuYI_6yAHqeyPKRL3TGuVZ7Cwtc6R1SAmZdcSOU9s-eOnDTN9gU align="left")

3. **Create a wallet**
    

You need to create a wallet before creating accounts and signing transactions with them. To do so, type the below command:

```javascript
forc-wallet new
```

This will require a password to encrypt the wallet. After the wallet is created, you will be shown the mnemonic phrase.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/T3t8Tf1cTeBJXzfyHJchSB3wJ5UnALZTJhys5fWSFOccAJcDJEp5XVP6RNWSSSG7F7loQr8cbdkQGRWfOw1HKZXUVCP4PZA6WLOk8_MVDxbS4ToopuhGoHh4ebiAKy9H_jLN93vtdOxN1g26V3oaI2g align="left")

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/KjgM9xcvCwUcnNxseQzxcvLWMbWuJMTOUsQUUJ4Di8ugBfH72ok0NmpE-4PW8oJB6VO335IorYlueQPuRpQYWAdn13BYgTEh8cYp_eqZDDt-ZYIeEWtWyakWeS7ZXVqsdUGAB7Z4w6E9xRj42hPoJy4 align="left")

Note: You will need your password for signing and account derivation, as well as your mnemonic phrase if you wish to recover your wallet in the future.

4. **Create an account**
    

To create an account for the wallet and get the wallet address, you can run the following:

```javascript
forc-wallet account new
```

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/8rzyJX0u0Lejc-SUt2sLD6ZgWi_Q4iEoa704GX2u4KMf99aLeIWCTwD38YBoO-6xmI-2anc_rmbifq4hOOpoPZTIWA3EdXon47sNaofJ78lHNU5vRnykqHPh6f9O4u4nfX_a4F6W1vPXftDLvRULSSM align="left")

This will require your wallet password (the one you chose during creation). This command will always derive the next account that has not yet been derived locally.

5. **To list all accounts derived so far, use the following:**
    

```javascript
forc-wallet accounts
```

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-MtCtMTDU54_I_0ZhfwGrmMWWzdQ7vN92APH1Dtlh1xddVKtg4VPr05jovyNXwuAxa3mSol0soS9-YsDbZs3r6sc_t6HV9JAo3y9aswBzhI6NQQDtBHcz6QPaG7ojcv516_DOyvydPhhhbg4LL3amUk align="left")

Note: When we **"create"** an account, we just reveal it. All accounts are derived deterministically based on the wallet's mnemonic phrase and derivation path. `forc-wallet` Will cache the public addresses of derived accounts within `~/.fuel/wallets/accounts`

## Conclusion
