Text-to-image models didn't exist until deep neural networks advanced in the mid-2010s. However, generative AI has been a hot topic long before ChatGPT. OpenAI's DALL-E, Google Brain's Imagen, and StabilityAI's Stable Diffusion are some text-to-image models that gained attention due to their ability to create images resembling real photographs and hand-drawn artwork. These generative AI models have been a game-changer in the field of AI.

## Best 9 Open Source Text to Image Models

So, let’s look at the top 9 open-source image generation models that can help you.

## 1\. DreamShaper

Dream Shaper V7, the popular image generation model based on diffusion architecture, introduces significant improvements in LoRA support and overall realism. It further enhances the features of Version 6, including increased LoRA support, better style enhancements, and improved generation at a height of 1024 pixels (although caution is recommended while using this feature).

## **Common features**

The models implemented in this process utilize foundation models or pretrained transformers, which are large neural networks that have been trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data and can be used for various tasks with the aid of additional fine-tuning. In addition, they employ diffusion-based models, which are generative models that create images by gradually adding noise to an initial image and then reversing the process, producing high-resolution images with fine details and realistic textures.

Furthermore, these models utilize grounding inputs or spatial information, which are additional inputs that guide the generation process to adhere to the composition specified by the user. These inputs can be bounding boxes, keypoints, or images, and can be used to control the layout, pose, or style of the generated image. They also employ neural style transfer or adversarial networks, which are techniques that enable the models to apply different artistic styles to the generated images, such as impressionism, cubism, or abstract, resulting in beautiful and unique artworks from text inputs.

Lastly, these models use natural language requests or text prompts, which are the primary inputs that guide the generation of images. These requests do not require knowledge of or entering code and can be simple or complex, descriptive or abstract, factual or fictional. The models use what they have learned from their training data to generate images that they believe correspond to the requests.
