GPUs are crucial for successfully implementing artificial intelligence (AI) applications, especially those with generative models like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). Unfortunately, the demand for GPUs far exceeds the available supply, resulting in a global chip shortage that significantly impacts AI performance regarding location and presence results. We must identify and address the root causes of this issue to overcome its consequences and ensure that AI applications can continue to develop and thrive.

## **Reason for the unavailability of the GPU**

The shortage of GPUs has been primarily caused by the unprecedented growth of AI tools and services, which require massive amounts of computing power for their development and training. [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), the leading GPU manufacturer for AI applications, has witnessed a significant surge in demand for its products, particularly ChatGPT and other generative models. In response to the increasing popularity of these applications, Nvidia has introduced a range of graphics cards specifically designed for the AI industry, including the highly acclaimed A100 and H100. However, despite its best efforts, the company struggles to meet the soaring demand for its products.

The scarcity of GPUs can be attributed to various factors, including geopolitical tensions between the US and China. The trade restrictions and chip export limitations have exacerbated the issue. Being heavily invested in the Chinese market, Nvidia has resorted to selling modified versions of [A100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/) and [H100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/) to bypass US restrictions. Additionally, since the Chinese market lacks AI-enabled chips, Nvidia's upgraded chips, known as the A800 and H800, are sold at exorbitant prices, [up to 40% above MSRP.](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-ai-gpus-shortage-price-hikes/)

The ongoing shortage of GPUs can be attributed to various factors, with the legacy of the cryptocurrency boom being a significant contributor. The surge in demand for GPUs caused by former crypto miners turning to AI for profitability has further intensified the situation. Additionally, the outdated or damaged older GPUs previously used for mining have reduced resource availability, adding to the shortage.

## The consequences of the current GPU shortage **and Imminent Threat of AI Monopolization**

The absence of GPUs significantly hinders AI development and innovation, resulting in various negative consequences. One of the most critical implications is the inflated costs and prolonged waiting times for accessing GPUs in the cloud. [Datanami reports](https://www.datanami.com/2021/03/12/the-chip-shortage-seems-to-be-impacting-ai-workloads-in-the-cloud/) that chip scarcity leads to long wait times and exorbitant prices for cloud GPU users. For instance, Nvidia's V100 card, launched in 2018, [costs over $10,000](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/nvidias-a100-is-the-10000-chip-powering-the-race-for-ai-.html), and the waiting period has surged to a staggering six months from order.

The decline in AI tools and services directly results from lacking GPUs. This has made it extremely challenging for smaller companies and researchers to compete with larger players with more resources and influence in the hardware market. However, the escalating scarcity of AI compute resources poses a critical threat to this promising trajectory. With demand for these resources doubling every three months and the supply remaining stagnant, the costs spiral out of control. This imbalance could soon make AI development the exclusive realm of major corporations and governments, leading to the risk of becoming a control machine wielded by a few powerful entities for their interests.

The manufacturing and consumption of GPUs have a significant environmental impact, which is only set to increase in the absence of these devices. GPUs are power-hungry and demand significant hardware and energy to function. If the production of chips continues without addressing performance and efficiency issues, this could worsen the carbon footprints and e-waste problems associated with AI development. It's high time we address this issue and ensure that AI remains accessible to all for the greater good of society.

## **The Temporary Solution to GPU Scarcity**

In the AI era, GPU scarcity has become a major challenge. However, there are several solutions to overcome this problem. One of the most effective solutions is to believe is to optimize hardware usability and performance through software approaches. CentML, an AI startup that emerged from theft in 2023, has claimed to use a powerful open-source compiler that automatically tunes optimizations to optimize performance for the company's specific inference pipeline and hardware. By extending the current AI chip supply yield and legacy inventory without affecting accuracy, CentML has increased access to compute in a “broken” marketplace for GPUs. This approach has proven to be an efficient way to combat the shortage of GPUs in the market.

It's imperative to diversify the hardware choices and sources of AI applications. One way to achieve this is to explore new architectures like field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), or neuromorphic chips that offer superior performance or efficiency for specific AI tasks. Additionally, companies must venture beyond Nvidia or China to discover new suppliers or partners who can provide more dependable and cost-effective GPUs.

One potential solution is implementing strict environmental standards to regulate hardware production and consumption. This may involve imposing taxes or incentives on GPU manufacturers or users based on their carbon emissions or e-waste production. Governments and organizations may also introduce transparency and accountability measures to ensure fair and uniform GPU allocations for AI development.

## **DePIN Compute as a Permanent Solution**

The potential of consumer GPUs is immense and yet largely untapped. [DePIN compute](https://www.spheron.network/) organizations have developed a cutting-edge solution that harnesses this potential and transforms it into a powerful force for AI compute. This platform leverages state-of-the-art web3 technology that enables users to tap into the underutilized consumer GPUs and accelerate them, unlocking a new frontier in AI development. With this platform, they are not just providing the necessary compute power for AI; They ensure that AI remains a democratic, inclusive, and safe technology that serves the world rather than being weaponized by a few.

## DePIN Empowering Individuals for a Safer AI Future

We must democratize its development to prevent AI from being used as a control tool. DePIN compute companies approach incentivizes individuals to contribute their GPU resources to their network, thereby decentralizing AI compute power. Contributors receive utility tokens, creating a sustainable and mutually beneficial ecosystem. This approach is economically viable and critical to ensuring that AI remains a tool for positive change. With a decentralized network that includes accelerated and optimized consumer GPUs, Users can guarantee that AI development is accessible to startups and developers, fostering innovation and creativity.

## **Conclusion**

In conclusion, the current GPU shortage presents significant challenges for AI development and innovation, leading to inflated costs, extended wait times, and limited accessibility for smaller companies and researchers. Geopolitical tensions, the aftermath of the cryptocurrency boom, and environmental concerns further complicate the situation. To tackle these issues, temporary solutions such as optimizing hardware usability and performance through software approaches, exploring new architectures, and diversifying hardware sources should be implemented.

Furthermore, embracing permanent solutions like DePIN compute platforms, which leverage underutilized consumer GPUs, ensures a more equitable distribution of AI compute power and prevents AI development's centralization in a few powerful entities. By empowering individuals to contribute their GPU resources to a decentralized network, we can promote a safer, more democratic, and inclusive future for AI technology.
