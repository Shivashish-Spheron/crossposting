## How did Nvidia generate such high revenue in the fiscal year 2024?

Nvidia's success in the past year was inevitable, given the company's years of hard work in building a comprehensive and integrated stack of chips, systems, software and services for accelerated computing, with a primary focus on data centers, cloud computing and edge computing. The company found itself at the center of a massive demand cycle due to the hype around generative AI, which was mainly kicked off by the late 2022 arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT, a chatbot powered by a large language model that can understand complex prompts and respond with an array of detailed answers.

The tech industry found more promise than concern with the capabilities of ChatGPT and other generative AI applications that had emerged in 2022, like the [DALL-E 2](https://blog.spheron.network/top-15-open-source-llms-for-2024-and-their-uses) and Stable Diffusion text-to-image models. Many of these models and applications had been trained and developed using Nvidia GPUs because the chips are far faster at computing such large amounts of data than CPUs ever could.

The enormous potential of these generative AI applications kicked off a massive wave of new investments in AI capabilities by companies of all sizes, from venture-backed startups to cloud service providers and consumer tech companies, like Amazon Web Services and Meta.

Nvidia's data center GPU, the [H100](https://www.crn.com/news/data-center/nvidia-gtc-hopper-gpus-grace-cpus-software-debut-with-ai-focus), with a new feature called the Transformer Engine, was designed to speed up the training of transformer models by as many as six times compared to the previous-generation A100. Among the transformer models that benefitted from the H100's Transformer Engine was GPT-3.5, short for Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3.5. This is OpenAI's large language model that exclusively powered ChatGPT before the introduction of the more capable GPT-4.

[Nvidia's CUDA](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/232300447/nvidia-pushes-parallel-computing-opens-up-cuda-programming-model) parallel computing platform and programming model allowed the company's GPUs to run HPC workloads faster than CPUs by breaking them down into smaller tasks and processing those tasks simultaneously. Since its introduction in 2007, CUDA has dominated the landscape of software that benefits accelerated computing.

Over the last several years, Nvidia's stack has grown to include CPUs, SmartNICs and data processing units, high-speed networking components, pre-integrated servers and server clusters as well as a variety of software and services, which includes everything from software development kits and open-source libraries to orchestration platforms and pretrained models.

**Nvidia's data center business grew by 217% to $47.5 billion in its 2024 fiscal year, which represented 78% of total revenue. This was mainly supported by a 244% increase in data center compute sales, with high GPU demand driven mainly by the development of generative AI and large language models.** Cloud service providers and consumer internet companies contributed a substantial portion of Nvidia's data center revenue, with the former group representing roughly half and then more than a half in the third and fourth quarters, respectively.

[Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/18/nvidia-announces-gb200-blackwell-ai-chip-launching-later-this-year.html) stated that this represents the industry's continuing transition from general-purpose computing, where CPUs were the primary engines, to accelerated computing, where GPUs and other kinds of powerful chips are needed to provide the right combination of performance and efficiency for demanding applications.

## **GPU sales saw 32% year-over-year increase in Q4 — AMD's market share rises to 19%**

[**According to a report from Jon Peddie Research**](https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/shipments-of-graphics-add-in-boards-increase-for-third-quarter-in-a-row/), the discrete graphics card market saw a remarkable recovery in Q4 of last year, with shipments rising by 6.8% compared to Q3 2023 and a staggering 32% compared to Q4 2022. Both Nvidia and AMD experienced growth in sales quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year, but AMD's growth was considerably higher, increasing its market share to 19%. The CPU market is also recovering, with shipments returning to 2022 levels.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1712902995353/2757ce21-10cb-401b-9dda-bba97c83b05a.png align="center")

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic driving up the sales of discrete GPUs in 2020 and 2021, shipments declined sharply in 2022, probably due to a globally weakening economy that led some countries into recession. However, the graphics card sales saw a significant recovery in 2023, and Q4 continued this trend with a 6.8% gain in shipments.

As a result of these consecutive quarterly increases in shipments, Q4 of 2023 witnessed 32% more discrete GPUs shipped than in Q4 of 2022. The difference is almost 40% compared to Q1 of 2023. Though Jon Peddie Research didn't elaborate much on the highlights of its GPU market report, rising desktop gaming GPU sales played a significant role in the increased sales seen in Q3, and perhaps that continued into Q4.

The CPU shipments are similarly recovering rapidly, with Q4 outperforming three of 2022's quarters. Though the CPU market has recovered better than the discrete graphics card market, it's still insufficient to put it on par with 2020 and 2021, which saw some of the highest shipments on record.

Intel's shipments were mostly flat among the three major GPU vendors, while Nvidia and AMD saw quarterly and yearly growth. Nvidia's shipments went up 4.7% from Q3 and 22.3% from Q4 of 2022, but that's nothing compared to AMD's gains of 17% quarter-to-quarter and 117% year-over-year. AMD has fueled a decent chunk of the GPU market's recovery in Q4 and 2023.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1712903127012/a20067ce-83c8-411a-b9ea-378828da7adc.png align="center")

As AMD grew faster than Nvidia, its market share increased to 19% - up from 17% in Q3. AMD's market share is also up 7% compared to Q4 of 2022, which had been a terrible year for Radeon graphics cards. According to Jon Peddie Research, AMD was only at 10% market share in Q3 of 2022, likely the lowest since buying ATI and its Radeon graphics business in 2006. Although 17% is still relatively low, it's undoubtedly an improvement.

Jon Peddie, the founder of the eponymous research firm, states that GPU customers are "pretty damn happy and vote with their dollars," which explains the increasing shipments. Though the market seems to be "entering a golden age," Peddie warns us not to get ahead of ourselves and overreact, as we did in the past with crypto and Covid.

## Need Army of 720,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs

According to the research [report by Factorial Funds](https://www.factorialfunds.com/blog/under-the-hood-how-openai-s-sora-model-works), it is estimated that a whopping 720,000 high-end Nvidia H100 GPUs will be required to support the creator community of TikTok and YouTube. In addition, Sora, as Factorial Funds has pointed out, requires up to 10,500 powerful GPUs for a month to train and can generate only about 5 minutes of video per hour per GPU for inference. As shown in the chart below, training this requires significantly more computing power than GPT4 or still image generation. However, with widespread adoption, inference will surpass training in compute usage. This implies that the computer power needed to create new videos (inference) will become greater than the power needed to train the AI model initially as more people and companies start using AI models like Sora to generate videos.

![(Factorial Funds)](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/9wLI0W8A7smjaj80UAjHX7j751fgt7K0RZZUCiPQTJLgGyb07_p32zC6YAK0ACK6BE-k0wiVkonAnk5mzWgFYQjSDqUfjdXia9VnyUnjrUAcjurAKvfrz0ZkLFWUyCRCyWcwRPlr4-U4UBGkLsCGxhY align="left")

To put things in perspective, it is worth noting that [Nvidia shipped 550,000](https://www.hpcwire.com/2023/08/17/nvidia-h100-are-550000-gpus-enough-for-this-year/) of the H100 GPUs in 2023. Data from Statista shows that the twelve largest customers using Nvidia's H100 GPUs collectively have 650,000 of the cards, and the two largest—Meta and Microsoft—have 300,000 between them. Assuming a cost of $30,000 per card, it would take $21.6 billion to bring Sora's dreams of AI-generated text-to-video mainstream, which is nearly the entire market cap of [AI tokens](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/artificial-intelligence).

![(Statista)](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/vxVDFShBa2SikydWPQZ0oQKX-86zKba1DvAmsHE4NACvJmhmykopfXGYCFbCptzsyRLnXvb_J9xyItQLoYV6-McfTS1pMA-61lUeNfPRc5sHXLqmmuYpZF_UgB4qoZRvJXOyZe_ZWaboRnrWsJRMj_I align="left")

It is important to note that even if you have the financial resources to acquire all the GPUs needed to support the TikTok and YouTube creator community, physically getting your hands on them could be challenging.

## Nvidia isn't the only game in town

It's crucial to acknowledge that despite its reputation, Nvidia isn't the only player in the AI game. AMD, its long-time chip rival, offers competing products that investors have rewarded handsomely, driving its stock from the $2 range in 2012 to over $170 today.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1712921848754/77997121-3e9a-422c-beb6-9283ddea1829.png align="center")

While Render (RNDR) and Akash Network (AKT) offer distributed GPU computing, it's worth noting that most of the GPUs on these networks are retail-grade gaming GPUs, which are significantly less powerful than Nvidia's server-grade H100 or AMD's competition.

The text-to-video promise Sora and other protocols pledge will require a monumental hardware lift. Although it's an exciting premise that could revolutionize Hollywood's creative workflow, it's unlikely to become mainstream anytime soon. Simply put, we'll need more chips.

## How DePIN Democratizes Innovation, Overcome GPU Shortages and Establish Trust

The GPU shortage will drive the mainstream adoption of Web3 infrastructure. High-end graphics processing units (GPUs) such as the NVIDIA A100s and H100s are essential for training artificial intelligence (AI) models. However, these GPUs are extremely expensive, have limited availability, and are only required for a short period for each model. This combination makes it impossible for many startups to own them.

Decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) provide the solution, particularly compute and storage networks. These networks will revolutionize AI and Web3 for two primary reasons: access and safety.

The emergence of AI will be the turning point for Web3 infrastructure since these protocols offer solutions to the data challenges and GPU shortages faced by AI startups. DePINs will transform AI development, making high-cost resources accessible to smaller players, democratizing AI innovation, and allowing hardware owners to generate passive income.

DePIN provides the antidote for trustworthy code and the physical infrastructure networks on which it runs. It's important to note that if startup founders build their apps on infrastructure controlled by internet Goliaths like Amazon Web Services (AWS), it becomes challenging for startups to compete since they have to pay a significant portion of their revenues to their competitors and take on counterparty risk.
