If you decide between these two GPUs, read on for our detailed comparison of the RTX 4090 vs. RX 7900 XTX.

### Radeon RX 7900 XTX vs. GeForce RTX 4090: GPU Showdown

Before diving into the performance numbers, let's quickly recap the key features of each card. The GeForce RTX 4090 is NVIDIA's latest and fastest flagship graphics card, built on the AD102 chip and Ada Lovelace architecture. It boasts 16,384 CUDA cores and 24GB of GDDR6X memory. Additionally, it features 128 3rd generation RT cores, 512 4th generation Tensor cores, Shader Execution Reordering, Ada Optical Flow accelerator, dual NVENC encoders with AV1 support, and DLSS 3 or AI Frame Generation technology, which is exclusive to the RTX 40 series GPUs.

In contrast, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX is AMD's premier GPU, utilizing the RDNA 3 architecture and a chiplet design. It employs a 5nm fabrication process for the Graphics Compute Die and a 6nm process for the Memory Cache Die. The Navi 31 GPU within it includes 6,144 Stream processors and 24GB of GDDR6 memory. AMD's latest GPU also features second-generation ray tracing technology, a dual media engine capable of 8K60 HEVC decoding and encoding, and AV1 encoding support. While NVIDIA is already employing 3rd generation RT cores for ray tracing and 8th gen NVENC with dual AV1 video encoders, AMD's FSR upscaling solution lacks the Frame Generation technology seen in NVIDIA's DLSS 3.

### Architectural Differences

The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX was launched alongside the RX 7900 XT, featuring the company's latest RDNA 3 architecture. Similarly, NVIDIA introduced its new Ada Lovelace architecture through the RTX 4090, RTX 4080, and RTX 4070. NVIDIA uses TSMC's 4nm manufacturing process, while AMD employs larger 5nm and 6nm processes.

Following Intel’s example with its hybrid CPU core design, AMD separated the main graphics compute die (GCD) and memory cache die (MCD), with the GCD built on the 5nm node and the MCD on the 6nm node. This approach reduces costs and allocates the critical components (GCD) to the more advanced node. While AMD could potentially challenge the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 with a larger GCD, the RX 7900 XTX stands as the RDNA 3 flagship GPU, though it does not match the RTX 4090 in performance.

### Performance Comparison

The NVIDIA RTX 4090 is currently the most powerful GPU available, capable of handling games at an 8K resolution. Despite the fact that most gamers use monitors with resolutions lower than 4K, the RTX 4090's performance remains unmatched. In most games and synthetic benchmarks, it significantly outperforms the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX.

However, the RTX 4090 is also significantly more expensive, priced $600 higher than the RX 7900 XTX. Despite its lower price, the RX 7900 XTX still delivers excellent performance and can run games at 4K smoothly.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090, at its worst, ties with the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and, at its best, significantly outperforms it, especially with ray tracing enabled at both 2K and 4K resolutions. On average, the RTX 4090 enjoys about a 25% performance advantage. While AMD aims the RX 7900 XTX at the RTX 4080, its performance without ray tracing often exceeds 120 FPS and ranges from 60 to 120 FPS with ray tracing, ensuring smooth gameplay.

### Price Comparison and Availability

The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX starts at $999 USD, whereas the NVIDIA RTX 4090 starts at $1,599 USD. The RTX 4090 is 60% more expensive at their respective launch prices than the RX 7900 XTX. The RX 7900 XTX offers better price performance than the RTX 4090.

Many RX 7900 XTX graphics cards sell below $999, while most RTX 4090 cards are still priced above their MSRP and are difficult to find at $1,599.

There are no current issues regarding availability. With crypto mining no longer a significant factor, there’s no new trend causing a shortage of graphics cards. Therefore, avoid scalpers and purchase these cards directly from major retailers like Amazon.

### RX 7900 XTX vs. RTX 4090 Conclusion – Which GPU is Superior?

The benchmark results are clear: the RTX 4090 is approximately 26% faster on average in 4K gaming. However, it is also 60% more expensive than the RX 7900 XTX. While the 7900 XTX may not match the 4090's ray tracing performance, it offers a better price per FPS. Ultimately, the best GPU depends on your specific needs and preferences.

This might be controversial, but the RTX 4090 could offer better value than the RX 7900 XTX for machine learning, deep learning, and AI workloads. The RTX 4090 also has several features that the RX 7900 XTX lacks, such as superior video encoding, DLSS 3 frame generation, and better upscaling technology.

Despite the RX 7900 XTX's better overall value, it isn't selling as well as the RTX 4090. Google Trends shows higher interest in the RTX 4090, and more reviews and purchases are seen on sites like Amazon and Newegg. Even a Steam survey indicates that the RTX 4090 is more popular than any of AMD’s RX 7000 GPUs.

Other media outlets and YouTubers recommend the RX 7900 XTX, yet many consumers still prefer the RTX 4090. People may be willing to pay more for the fastest gaming GPU and its additional features. However, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX offers a better FPS-per-dollar value than the RTX 4090.

## Conclusion

In summary, the RTX 4090 and RX 7900 XTX are excellent GPUs with strengths and weaknesses. Your choice will depend on your specific applications and requirements. The RTX 4090, while more expensive, offers additional features that the RX 7900 XTX lacks. Conversely, the RX 7900 XTX is more affordable and delivers better cost-performance in gaming, though it falls short in ray tracing and additional features compared to NVIDIA’s offerings.
