The rapidly growing fields of Artificial Intelligence, Graphics Processing, and the Metaverse create an insatiable demand for powerful and affordable computing capabilities. However, many data centers globally are operating well below their capacity, with the [US averaging only 12-18% utilization](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/data-center-efficiency-assessment-IP.pdf). This inefficiency results in bottlenecks that drive up the cost of GPU computing, making it prohibitively expensive for many businesses. To address this issue, various initiatives are underway to create a decentralized cloud network that harnesses these underutilized resources, prioritizing AI-related industries. We will explore some of the most promising projects tackling this challenge.

## AI Model Training and Inference: Understanding Compute Power Utilization

Compute power is primarily used in two main stages of artificial intelligence (AI) development: model training and inference.

* **Model Training:** This stage involves employing a machine learning algorithm to build a model using a training dataset. The goal is to create a model that can learn from the data and make predictions or decisions based on it.
    
* **Inference:** Once the model is trained, it can be applied to new datasets to generate outputs or "predictions." This stage is critical for understanding new data and making real-time decisions.
