Meta is stepping into the AI video generation arena with the introduction of its latest tool, [Movie Gen](https://ai.meta.com/research/movie-gen/). This new research preview showcases a video and sound generator that can handle complex visual effects (VFX) tasks such as replacing environments, extending sets, swapping characters, removing objects, and adding particle effects with realistic lighting interactions.

Movie Gen delivers video quality comparable to [OpenAI's Sora](https://openai.com/index/sora/) and allows users to upload their own photos and integrate them into the generated video. Users can enhance their creations further by adding custom sound effects generated from text descriptions.

Movie Gen represents Meta's third wave of advancements in generative AI.

Meta has shared this research, believing that such technology empowers users to express themselves in new, creative ways and provides opportunities to those who might not otherwise have access to such tools.

## What Is Movie Gen?

Movie Gen is a set of foundational models developed by Meta that generate high-quality videos and audio. These models are trained on extensive datasets comprising images, videos, and audio using a combination of text-to-image and text-to-video techniques.

The system generates 1080p HD videos in various aspect ratios, delivering state-of-the-art performance across multiple video generation tasks. Movie Gen's audio component can create synchronized soundtracks, including sound effects and music, that complement the generated visuals seamlessly.

The results of this tool are indeed impressive.

## How Does Movie Gen Work?

Movie Gen's models are built on a Transformer architecture, utilizing advanced techniques like flow matching during training. The training process consists of several stages, starting with pre-training on large datasets, followed by fine-tuning on high-quality, curated data to achieve realistic and aesthetically pleasing outputs.

The training approach began with treating image edits like single-frame video edits. Meta's team then created synthetic video editing tasks by animating these still images and leveraging AI models such as SAM and DINO for object segmentation. The models improved by learning to reconstruct the original videos from their edited versions.

Meta has published a [whitepaper](https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/movie-gen-research-paper/) detailing the technology behind Movie Gen for those interested in the finer technical aspects.

## Four Key Features of Movie Gen

1. **Movie Gen Video:** This 30-billion-parameter transformer model generates high-quality, high-definition images and videos from a single text prompt.
    
2. **Movie Gen Audio:** With 13 billion parameters, this model can take a video input and optional text prompts to create high-fidelity audio synchronized with the video. It generates ambient sound, background music, and foley sound with state-of-the-art alignment between video, audio, and text.
    
3. **Precision Video Editing:** Movie Gen enables localized edits, such as adding or removing objects, and global changes, like adjusting backgrounds or styles, using both generated and existing video content combined with text instructions.
    
4. **Personalized Videos:** The model can generate personalized videos with exceptional character preservation and realistic motion using a simple image and text prompt.
    

## Top Features of Movie Gen Video

1. **Text-to-Video Generation:** You can create videos simply by describing the desired scene with a text prompt.
    
    **Examples:**
    
    **| *Prompt:*** The camera is behind a man. The man is shirtless, wearing a green cloth around his waist. He is barefoot. With a fiery object in each hand, he creates wide circular motions. A calm sea is in the background. The atmosphere is mesmerizing, with the fire dance.
    
    ***Movie Gen Output:*** Meta's model generates a stunning video based on this detailed description.
