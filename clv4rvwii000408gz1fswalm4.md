Working with [artificial intelligence](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-ai-quick-start-guide-for-beginners) (AI) or [machine learning](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-machine-learning) (ML) and in need of a text-to-speech engine? If so, you'll require an open-source solution. Let's delve into how text-to-speech (TTS) engines function and explore some of the top open-source choices.

In this straightforward guide, we'll provide more information about TTS engines and present some of the best available options.

## What Is a Text-to-Speech (TTS) Engine?

Before diving into the list, let us give you a quick overview of a text-to-speech engine. A text-to-speech engine is a software that converts written text into spoken words. It uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze and comprehend the written text and then utilizes a speech synthesizer to create human-like speech. You can find TTS engines in various applications, such as virtual assistants, navigation systems, and accessibility tools. If you want to learn more about NLP, DataCamp provides a Natural Language Processing in Python skill track to help you improve your technical skills.

## What Are Open-Source Text-to-Speech (TTS) Engines?

Text-to-speech (TTS) engines are software tools that convert written text into spoken words. They are incredibly useful in various applications such as accessibility, automated voice responses, and virtual assistants. Open-source TTS engines, in particular, are developed by a community of developers and released under an open-source license. This means anyone is free to use, modify, and distribute the software without restrictions.

### 5\. MaryTTS (Multimodal Interaction Architecture)

![MaryTTS](https://marytts.github.io/images/marylogo.png align="left")

MaryTTS is an open-source, multilingual Text-to-Speech Synthesis platform written in Java. It was originally developed as a collaborative project of [DFKI](http://www.dfki.de/web)â€™[s La](http://www.dfki.de/web)[nguage Technology Laband the Institute of Ph](http://www.dfki.de/lt/)[oneticsat Saarland University](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/groups/WB/Phonetics/). [It is now maintain](http://www.uni-saarland.de/)ed by the [Multimodal Speech ProcessingGroup in the Cluster of Exce](http://m2ci.org/en/irg/msp)[llence MMCIand DFKI.](http://m2ci.org/)

Source: [MaryTTS GitHub](https://marytts.github.io/documentation/publications/schroeder_trouvain2003.pdf)

This architecture includes some basic components such as:

* A markup language parser: This component reads and interprets the markup language used in the text field.
    
* A processor: This component takes the parsed text and carries out any required actions, like converting it to speech or creating visual output.
    
* A synthesizer: This component generates the end result, whether it's audio or visual. It enhances the output with speech features, such as intonation and inflection, to make it sound more natural.
    

**Pros:** The MaryTTS architecture is highly customizable, enabling developers to create their parsers, processors, and synthesizers to suit their specific requirements. This flexibility also allows for easy software integration into various platforms and applications.

**Cons:** Developers unfamiliar with markup language and text-to-speech tech may face a learning curve due to its high customizability.

## Applications of TTS Engines

Here are some ways the above TTS engines can be used:

### 1\. Virtual assistants

Text-to-speech engines can be utilized to create virtual assistants that are similar to enterprise voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa. Additionally, some virtual assistants can provide accessibility support to users with visual impairments by enabling them to listen to written text instead of reading it.

### 2\. Automatic voice responses with AI voice

TTS engines are commonly used in automated systems, such as phone or chatbot assistants. These engines can provide more human-like responses by reading out prompts and interactions.

### **3\. Video/image voiceover**

Text-to-speech technology can be used to bring more life and interest to video or image content. For example, using the eSpeak engine, voiceovers can be added to videos in various languages, making them more accessible and appealing to a wider audience. This is especially useful for industries such as marketing, e-learning, and entertainment.

## Choosing The Best Engine for TTS Integration

Let's discuss how to select the right engine for your text-to-speech model. Consider these factors:

### 1\. Purpose and use case

Start by identifying your specific use case and the purpose of using TTS. Understand what features and customization options are necessary for your project, and then choose an engine accordingly.

### 2\. Language support

If you require support for a particular language or multiple languages, make sure to select an engine that offers such capabilities. In that case, going for the eSpeak engine may be a better option for you.

### 3\. Cost and budget

Before selecting an engine, consider your budget and resources. Open-source options may be cost-effective in the long run, but they may require additional resources for customization and implementation.

### 4\. Technical expertise

Evaluate your team's or your own skill level when working with TTS engines. If you lack technical expertise, consider opting for a commercial solution that provides user-friendly interfaces and support.

### 5\. Performance and Quality

It's important to choose a high-quality speech engine that produces natural-sounding audio. Consider testing different engines to find the one that best suits your needs.

## Final Thoughts

Text-to-speech technology has improved a lot, sounding more like humans talking. Now, there are lots of free options you can use in your apps, which is good because it's cheaper and easier. But there are also some problems you might face when using these free tools, so it's important to know about them before you decide to use them.
