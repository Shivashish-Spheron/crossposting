[Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular code editor used by developers around the world. It's known for its flexibility, extensions, and collaboration features. If you're looking to harness the power of VSCode in a server environment, [Spheron Compute](https://docs.spheron.network/sdk/compute/) offers a quick and efficient way to deploy a VSCode Server instance in just a few minutes. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process, so you can enjoy the benefits of coding in the cloud with VSCode. Let's get started!

## What is a VSCode Server?

The VS Code Server is a service built off the same underlying server used by the VS Code Remote Development extensions. It allows users to work in various environments, such as the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), remote machines via SSH, and dev containers directly from VS Code. The server is installed on the remote environment and enables the local VS Code to interact smoothly with remote source code and runtimes.

## **What is Spheron Network?**

[Spheron Network](https://spheron.network/) is a next-generation PaaS that offers low-cost and seamless access to Web3 infrastructure across multiple chains. It is explicitly designed to serve a broader audience, including startups, developers, and organizations looking to scale their infrastructure.

Spheron Network offers a Compute Marketplace that you can use to set up useful tools like VSCode Server quickly. With Spheron, you don't have to worry about the technical stuff and you can focus on using your VSCode Server with ease. In addition to compute, web hosting, and storage capabilities, Spheron offers many features to enhance productivity and enable stakeholders to reach new heights while prioritizing privacy, security, and reliability.

## **How do you deploy a VSCode Server using Spheron Compute?**

You can follow these steps to deploy a VSCode Server on Spheron Compute.

### **Step 1: Create a Free Spheron Network Account**

1. Visit Spheron Network: [https://spheron.network/](https://docs.spheron.network/)
    
2. On the Spheron homepage, locate and click the "Free Trial" button.
    
3. You'll be directed to a login/signup page. Choose your preferred authentication method: Web2 (GitHub account, GitLab account, or Bitbucket account) or Web3 (Ethereum).
    
4. Follow the provided prompts to authenticate your chosen account securely. This step ensures safe access to the Spheron Network platform.
    
5. After successful authentication, you'll be guided to a confirmation page confirming the completion of your account setup.
    

### **Step 2: Creating an Organization**

1. Upon logging in, navigate to the "Compute" section using the dropdown on the top right corner.
    
2. You'll be prompted to create your organization's name, username, and Avatar. Add and click “Save”.
    
3. Next, you'll be taken to a new page. Click the "New Cluster" button.
    

### **Step 3: Deploying a VSCode Server With Spheron Platform UI**

Follow these steps to deploy a VSCode Server:

1. Choose "Compute" to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
    
2. Choose the type of compute you need from the options under "Compute Type." You can pick the one that suits your requirements.
    

**NOTE:** Please schedule a team call to gain early access to On Demand Type.

1. Select "Start from Marketplace App".
    
2. Pick "VSCode Server" from the marketplace. It's as easy as choosing an app you want to install.
    
3. Select your preferred region for deployment. The container will be deployed in any region for Spot, or in the eu-east region for On Demand. Choosing a region closer to your users can improve performance and reduce latency. Spheron offers the following regions to choose from for Spot:
    
    * US-east
        
    * US-west
        
    * US-central
        
    * EU-west
        
    * Any
        

**NOTE:** It is recommended to select any region for Spot to get a higher chance of successful deployment as it will deploy on any providers in the network.

1. Next, Choose an instance plan that aligns with your requirements. Spheron will recommend a suitable plan according to the VSCode Server template, but you can customize it if needed from available plans or choose to 'Create Custom Plans'
    
2. Next, Configure storage:  
    You have to choose Storage from the available options. This storage will be volatile storage and is erased when the instance is restarted, redeployed, or shut down.
    
    Additionally, you get the option to choose Persistent Storage. Persistent storage will not be erased unless the instance is closed. If choosing persistent storage, specify the type of storage (HDD, SSD, NVMe) and Add mount point.
    
3. For advanced configurations, feel free to explore more options. Just [click here](https://spheron.network/) to learn more about these advanced settings.
    
4. Once you're all set, click "Deploy" to start the deployment process. It's as simple as that!
    

That's it! Your VSCode Server instance will now be deployed.

**NOTE:** Keep in mind that you can access the VSCode Server only after the Compute Instance is provisioned. So, allow some time for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

## **Connecting to the VSCode Server**

* To connect to your VSCode Server, use the Connection URL provided by Spheron under Port Policy Info.
    
* Once your VSCode Server instance is up and running, you can access it using the provided PASSWORD in the Additional Configuration.
