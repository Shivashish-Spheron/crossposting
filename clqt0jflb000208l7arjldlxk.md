[Reef Chain](https://reef.io/), with its EVM-compatible chain for DeFi and advanced features, is gaining traction in the blockchain space. If you want to become part of the Reef ecosystem, deploying a Reef Node is the first step. Whether you're a blockchain enthusiast, developer, or organization looking to participate in network validation, this quick deployment method will get you up and running without the hassle of manual configurations.

## **What is Spheron Network?**

[**Spheron Network**](https://spheron.network/) is a Web3 infrastructure platform that provides tools and services to decentralize cloud storage and computing. It allows audited data centers to join the Spheron marketplace. Spheron oversees the decentralized and governed nature of the infrastructure, ensuring permissionless access and heightened security for all users. **Spheron Compute offers a feature-rich alternative to traditional cloud services at only one-third of the cost.**

Spheron offers a [**Compute Marketplace**](https://docs.spheron.network/marketplace-guide), which allows users to set up valuable tools quickly and easily, whether they want to deploy databases, nodes, tools, or AI. With Spheron, you don't have to worry about the technical stuff, and you can focus on deploying your Node with ease. Spheron Network has also partnered with organizations like [**Shardeum**](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-and-stake-a-shardeum-validator-on-spheron-in-minutes), [**Avail**](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-an-avail-node-in-minutes-using-spheron-compute), [**Elixir**](https://blog.spheron.network/step-by-step-guide-to-launching-an-elixir-node-with-spheron), [**Filecoin**](https://filecoin.io/), [**Arbitrum**](https://arbitrum.io/), etc, to redefine access to it and promote a more decentralized, inclusive, and community-centric ecosystem.

**Spheron provides features such as Private images, Auto-scale instances, Scale on demand, Real-time instance metrics, Faster GPUs, Free Bandwidths, Terraform Providers and SDKs, Instance health checks, activity, shell access, and more. Spheron provides add-on storage solutions for long-term data storage and edge bandwidth acceleration through its global CDN.

### **Step 3: Deploying a Reef Node With Spheron Platform UI**

Follow these steps to deploy a Reef Node:

1\. Choose "Compute" to use CPU-based instances for running containers.

2\. Choose your desired Compute Type option under Compute Type.

**NOTE:** Please schedule a team call to gain early access to the **"Spot"** Type.

4\. **Select Region:** For the best experience, use the **US-WEST** region to deploy your node!

5\. Next, Choose an instance plan that aligns with your requirements. Spheron will recommend a suitable plan according to the Reef template, but you can customize it if needed from available plans or choose to **'Create Custom Plans.'**

6\. Next, Configure storage:  
You have to choose storage from the available options or the custom storage option that fits your needs. This storage will be volatile and is erased when the instance is restarted, redeployed, or shut down.

Additionally, you get the option to choose Persistent Storage. Persistent storage will not be erased unless the instance is closed. If choosing persistent storage, specify the type of storage (NVMe) and Add a mount point.
