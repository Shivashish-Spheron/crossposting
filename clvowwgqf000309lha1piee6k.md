Change is the only constant in an ever-evolving digital landscape. As part of our commitment to innovation and providing the best possible solutions to our users, **we've made the difficult decision to retire our storage service effective June 1st, 2024. This move is designed to streamline our services and focus on areas where we can deliver the most value to our users.**

## **Why Are We Making This Change?**

The decision to sunset our storage service was not made lightly. Over the years, this service has helped countless users efficiently upload files to IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave. However, as the storage ecosystem evolves, we find it increasingly important to focus our resources and efforts on services that best meet our user's current and future needs.

## **What This Means for You**

**If you are currently using our storage service, you will need to migrate your files to another platform by June 1st, 2024. After this date, the service will no longer be available, and access to your storage data on our platform will be discontinued as we take down all the IPFS nodes we are maintaining.**

## **Steps to Migrate Your Site**

1. **Evaluate Alternative Platforms**: Start by researching alternative storage services. When choosing a new platform, consider factors such as ease of use, pricing, scalability, and support.
    
2. **Plan Your Migration**: Since our IPFS nodes are open to other node sync and are very seamless, you can use the CIDs you got from Spheron SDK and use the same to pull data to your new platform pinning service. Ensure to test your file accessibility thoroughly on the new platform before making the switch.
    
3. **Communicate with Your Users**: Inform your site visitors about the move in advance. This can be done through website banners, email notifications, or social media announcements.
    

## **How We Can Help**

We understand this transition may be challenging and are here to help. Over the coming months, we will provide resources, guides, and support to assist you in migrating your storage files smoothly and efficiently.

Additionally, our [**support team**](https://community.spheron.network/) is available to answer any questions about the migration process or assist with any challenges you may encounter along the way.

## **Looking Ahead**

We're grateful for your support of our storage service and look forward to continuing to serve you with our other offerings.
