Deep learning is transforming industries and creating new possibilities in healthcare, finance, entertainment, and many more. However, deep learning algorithms require powerful hardware to run efficiently and effectively. Access to hardware is essential for the smooth training of complex neural networks.

Graphical Processing Units ([GPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit)) have emerged as the backbone of deep learning systems, surpassing the capabilities of Central Processing Units ([CPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)) due to their parallel processing capabilities. However, this comes at a premium because GPUs are pricey. This article will help you understand how GPUs work and identify the top five cost-effective ones for deep learning.

## What is Deep Learning?

[Deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) is a subset of [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) that employs algorithms to model high-level abstractions in data. This method is based on the structure and function of the brain, often referred to as [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network). Deep learning simulates how our brain works, enabling systems to learn, identify objects, and perform complex tasks with increasing accuracy without human intervention. This machine-learning technique teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example.

Deep learning can automatically learn and improve from experience, examining algorithms and adjusting them for better performance. It's a powerful tool in [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), imitating how humans gain specific knowledge.

## What is GPU for Deep Learning?

GPUs are electronic circuits specialised in manipulating and altering memory at high speeds to speed up image creation in a frame buffer intended to be displayed on a device. GPUs have been repurposed in deep learning due to their ability to perform multiple, simultaneous computations.

The parallel architecture of GPUs makes them exceptionally well-suited for intensive computation tasks like deep learning. They excel at executing matrix operations and performing multiple calculations simultaneously, which are fundamental in training neural networksâ€”making GPUs indispensable tools for deep learning.

## How do GPUs for Deep Learning Work?

[Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) Stream Architecture is widely used in GPUs today. This design enables them to perform parallel operations and perform more efficiently for specific tasks. When training a deep learning model, the model's parameters are updated using [gradient descent optimization algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent), which involve numerous matrix calculations.

The parallel processing capability of GPUs is beneficial for deep learning tasks, as they require extensive computations on large amounts of data. GPUs excel at performing these matrix operations in parallel, resulting in a substantial speedup in training times.

GPU-accelerated deep learning frameworks offer flexibility to design and train custom deep neural networks. These frameworks provide interfaces to commonly used programming languages, making it easier for developers to leverage the power of GPUs.

## How to Choose the Best GPU for Deep Learning

When selecting a graphics processing unit (GPU) for deep learning tasks, there are various important aspects to consider. One key aspect is the size of the GPU's memory because it dictates how big the artificial neural networks that you can train can be. Therefore, having more GPU memory lets you work with bigger models or increase the batch size during training.

Another major factor to consider is the GPU's computing power, often expressed in terms of floating-point operations per second (FLops). In general, a greater FLop count signifies a stronger GPU.

Moreover, energy efficiency becomes relevant when conducting extensive training projects. Energy-efficient GPUs can help reduce electrical expenses over time.

Lastly, cost plays a vital role. You must find a balance between affordability and meeting the performance needs of your specific deep-learning activities.

Additionally, here are other elements worth taking into account:

* **CUDA cores:** Their quantity impacts the GPU's ability to process information. Normally, a higher number of CUDA cores translates to shorter training periods.
    
* **Memory (VRAM):** For effective training, ensure your GPU has enough video RAM to manage your dataset and deep learning model.
    
* **Memory bandwidth:** This feature enables swift data transfers between the GPU and its memory, which is beneficial for executing complex calculations promptly.
    
* **Tensor cores:** Some GPUs have specialized ones designed explicitly for handling matrix operations that are common in deep learning. These components can considerably boost particular processes.
    
* **Compatibility:** Verify whether the GPU works seamlessly with your equipment and software configuration. Make sure it supports widely-used deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
