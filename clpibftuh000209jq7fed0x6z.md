## The Spark of Curiosity

After launching [Spheron GPU](https://spheron.network/), our curiosity was piqued: what's all the fuss about GPUs? We often hear about their superiority over CPUs in AI tasks, so we decided to put it to the test. What happens when you pit GPU against CPU in model training? That’s exactly what we wanted to find out.

**So, we grabbed the TensorFlow Docker images - yep, there are different flavors for GPU and CPU. We set up the** [**Tensorflow CPU**](https://app.spheron.network/#/compute/marketplace?template=TensorFlow%20CPU) **on a CPU instance and the** [](https://hub.docker.com/layers/tensorflow/tensorflow/latest-gpu-jupyter/images/sha256-2de4ac3c6e8360a1e57b7dc4fca8d061daf7c58b61de31da1f0aca11c18bab32?context=explore)[**Tensorflow GPU**](https://app.spheron.network/#/compute/marketplace?template=TensorFlow%20GPU) **on an Nvidia RTX A4000 GPU from our Spheron marketplace. Let the games begin!**

## Accessing Your Jupyter Notebook

Post-deployment, you get a handy link to the Jupyter Notebook. But, heads up! It'll ask for a password or token. No sweat though, just check your logs for the token. It might need a little refresh or a couple of minutes of patience to grab it from the network.

## Jumping into Pre-loaded Notebooks

Big shoutout to the [**TensorFlow**](https://www.tensorflow.org/) team! They’ve loaded some nifty notebooks (.ipynb files) in the image. Talk about not starting from scratch. We jumped straight into testing a text classification model using Keras and TensorFlow.

## Under the Hood: TensorFlow and CUDA

Here’s where we corrected a misconception. When you import TensorFlow, it does check for a GPU. But, the magic happens thanks to CUDA, NVIDIA’s parallel computing platform and application programming interface. It's CUDA that really kicks the GPU into high gear for TensorFlow. Just remember, the standard TensorFlow image without **'gpu'** in its tag won’t have CUDA. It's essential for GPU acceleration.

## Checking GPU Availability

How do you confirm if your instance is GPU-ready? Try these:

1. Run `nvidia-smi` in your instance shell. It gives you the lowdown on the GPU specs and usage.
    
2. In TensorFlow, check with `print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))`. This confirms if TensorFlow can access the GPU, which it will prefer for model training.
    

Still, having issues accessing GPU? Check this [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) from TensorFlow

## The Real Test: Training Time

With the GPU-enabled notebook ready, we were buzzing to see the performance boost! We set off all the cells in the `text_classification.ipynb` notebook, especially keen on the [`model.fit`](https://spheron.network/)`(...)` part for 10 epochs. We even timed it to compare against our CPU instance. The verdict? The GPU did speed things up, but maybe our expectations were a tad high. Still, halving the training time is nothing to sneeze at! Plus, we only tapped into 5% of the GPU's potential – there’s more power under the hood.

## Conclusions and Next Adventures

Our CPU vs. GPU benchmarking was a blast! We’re already planning to pit different GPUs against each other next. It’s going to be fascinating to see how various models perform across different GPUs.
