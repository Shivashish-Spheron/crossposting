It allows audited data centers to join the Spheron marketplace. Spheron oversees the decentralized and governed nature of the infrastructure, ensuring permissionless access and heightened security for all users. **Spheron Compute offers a feature-rich alternative to traditional cloud services at only one-third of the cost.**

Spheron offers a [**Compute Marketplace**](https://docs.spheron.network/marketplace-guide), which allows users to set up valuable tools quickly and easily, whether they want to deploy databases, nodes, tools, or AI. With Spheron, you don't have to worry about the technical stuff, and you can focus on deploying your Node with ease. Spheron Network has also partnered with organizations like [**Shardeum**](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-and-stake-a-shardeum-validator-on-spheron-in-minutes), [**Avail**](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-an-avail-node-in-minutes-using-spheron-compute), [**Elixir**](https://blog.spheron.network/step-by-step-guide-to-launching-an-elixir-node-with-spheron), [**Filecoin**](https://filecoin.io/), [**Arbitrum**](https://arbitrum.io/), etc, to redefine access to it and promote a more decentralized, inclusive, and community-centric ecosystem.

**Spheron provides features such as Private images, Auto-scale instances, Scale on demand, Real-time instance metrics, Faster GPUs, Free Bandwidths, Terraform Providers and SDKs, Instance health checks, activity, shell access, and more. Spheron provides add-on storage solutions for long-term data storage and edge bandwidth acceleration through its global CDN. With Spheron**[**,**](https://filecoin.io/) **you can easily set up your nodes in just a few minutes and enjoy low maintenance and operations costs and a great developer experience.**

## What is Lava Network?

[Lava](https://www.lavanet.xyz/) is the first modular data access layer for blockchains. It introduces `specs`: a modular primitive that lets contributors permissionlessly add support for new chains and data services to the base protocol. RPC is the first service supported by the protocol, but they are soon bringing further choices by integrating with indexing and API partners, such as Subsquid.

Data consumers send requests to Lava’s network of data providers (node operators)[,](https://docs.lavanet.xyz/spec) who join Lava to meet data demand. Lava creates dynamic, scalable markets around any blockchain data service. The protocol also creates crypto-economic guarantees around the quality of service across speed, uptime, and data accuracy.

By leveraging modular architecture and a peer-to-peer network of node operators, [Lava](https://docs.lavanet.xyz/spec) creates a unified platform for accessing the multi-chain world.

**Why is Moniker important?**

Once your node is set up and running as a validator, you can view its status and activity through the Lava Validator Dashboard at [**this link**](https://lava.explorers.guru/validators)**.**

### Step 4: Provision Your Node and Access the Shell

1\. Click the **"Deploy"** button to deploy the node successfully.

2\. Wait for your node to be fully set up. After it's provisioned, you'll see an option called **‘Overview’** in the dashboard; click on it to see all the details of the deployed node on Lava Network.

3\. Now, Click on the deployed `lava-validator-testnet` and go to **'Shell Command.'**

### Step 5: Create or Recover Your Wallet

**1.** To **create a new wallet** type in the Shell:

```javascript
lavad keys add wallet
```

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Iv48fNakX0Img0z4hU5m01vXiTHiOjSv5h5BWfw2OPKrznqg5qqiFRbgQ-LlpOE9fAZqSFHJW6Je1Xn9RA1kxIKvrdvmH04WWGxXUThWyroxhionsu6rUhgd2Hts27NdMfOhbB1sFAJCQyT5c_unWVk align="left")

**2\. To recover an existing wallet, use:**

```javascript
lavad keys add wallet --recover
```

Then, enter your mnemonic phrase when prompted.

### **Step 6: Fund Your Wallet**

1\. To receive funds, visit the **#faucet** channel on the [official Lava Network Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Tbk5NxTCdA). Here, you can request funds by sharing the address you previously created.

2\. **Check your wallet balance** using:

```javascript
lavad q bank balances $(lavad keys show wallet -a)
```

Make sure you have at least 100000ulava tokens.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/rwdRJQpBhENEvSBNXtZFm-nFKaBeNALx0wqC-3cCpQfsTBRumSbsvMlW0hJoGxxo73uwA61OOJ7jhnPelRXwD16gbmnGNawmKfHUhF_R77xaf_WZ_PGb1zqzRfsZnDd8AKhUqBefEZdQm3VUD6ZDM00 align="left")

3\. Your node might still be syncing with the blockchain if you don't see a balance. Wait until the **catching\_up** status is **false**.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/5hRICuavT0jlSsXTvpBbEmRGFfUzKMBukLQCr-ofTXqSipWE4lFztyj4tfMloDMzm5FtUIKPJTxxfqgOGSCn8Aod4MZNjF8bVI7UGUnRhGp8rwWBxhNm0IU6FGacldghSEf-yheQoPBN9u0H-GhV48o align="left")

**Monitor your wallet on the Lava Explorer:** Visit [Lava Explorer](https://lava.explorers.guru/validators) and enter your wallet address to keep an eye on your transactions and balance. This step is crucial for ensuring your wallet has been successfully funded and correctly reflects the blockchain transactions.

### Step 7: Verify Network Synchronization

Check the synchronization status with:

```javascript
lavad status | jq .SyncInfo
```

Proceed when `catching_up` turns to false.

### Step 8: Register Your Validator

Use the following command to create your validator, replacing placeholders with your information:

```javascript
lavad tx staking create-validator --amount=90000ulava --pubkey=$(lavad tendermint show-validator) --moniker "YOUR_MONIKER_NAME" --details "YOUR_DETAILS" --website "YOUR_WEBSITE_URL" --chain-id=lava-testnet-2 --commission-rate=0.1 --commission-max-rate=0.2 --commission-max-change-rate=0.05 --min-self-delegation=1 --gas="auto" --gas-adjustment "1.5" --gas-prices="0.05ulava" --from=wallet -y
```

**Customize the command with your details:** Replace **YOUR\_MONIKER\_NAME**, **YOUR\_DETAILS**, and **YOUR\_WEBSITE\_URL** with your information.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WTlyQWkXTSQMfqogWoYboGb6GZur-PDg2pD0fE9fRavCSIx-8WG_un4pB0GKYM3iBF25T3D2l83bsV8mwQ9p_TsSP_OXIVJtoJoyY4DEL0Y1r0xOZglbO8Unpt0RZn7qOQ3HPwlpOhulp1fBMJMnvjU align="left")

Now make sure you see the validator details:

```javascript
lavad q staking validator $(lavad keys show wallet --bech val -a)
```

**Wait a few minutes** after executing this command before checking your node on the [Lava Validators List](https://lava.explorers.guru/validators).
