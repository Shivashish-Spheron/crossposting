Spheron is on track to reach multiple major milestones this year, and to give you a better sense of what’s coming, we’ve decided to release [our whitepaper V1](https://spheron.network/whitepaper)!

This comprehensive document outlines our vision and technological foundation for decentralizing global GPU compute resources. We hope to give you an in-depth understanding of how Spheron is designed to democratize access to crucial GPU resources, lower costs, and power innovation across computation-heavy fields such as AI and machine learning.

Let’s dive in.

## A Blueprint for On-demand DePIN Compute

Whether you're a developer in need of computational power or a GPU owner interested in earning passive returns, Spheron has something to offer you. Our whitepaper is a cornerstone of our strategy to actualize this vision.

Key highlights include:

* **Ecosystem Vision and Opportunities**: Learn about the transformative potential of Spheron’s decentralized computing environment and how we plan on democratizing access to global GPU resources.
    
* **Key User Benefits**: Unpack all the benefits Spheron offers GPU users and providers alike, including performance bonuses for GPU providers and cost advantages that surpass that of traditional service providers.
    
* **Technical Product Details**: Gain insights into Spheron’s technical architecture, including how the Eigenlayer AVS-based matching engine works and how the system leverages the Arbitrum Orbit stack to achieve unrivaled scalability and speed.
    
* **Future Developments**: Catch a sneak peek of upcoming research priorities and potential enhancements to Spheron as we explore new avenues for increasing global GPU accessibility.
