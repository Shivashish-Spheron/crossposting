In the first phase of the evolution of blockchain technology, from 2008 to 2013, the focus was on transactions, with the emergence of [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) as the first decentralized cryptocurrency. This was followed by the introduction of Litecoin in 2011, which aimed to improve Bitcoin by offering faster transaction speeds, lower fees, and a more efficient mining process.

The second phase, from 2014 to 2017, saw the rise of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) and the concept of smart contracts. Ethereum, introduced by [Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin) in 2015, was the first platform to support decentralized applications (DApps), which are applications that run on a P2P network of computers rather than a single computer. This phase also marked the beginning of the decentralized finance boom, with digital currencies gaining traction globally.

The third phase, from 2018 to the present, is characterized by the widespread application of blockchain technology in various industries. This includes the development of new cryptocurrencies, which are aimed at the security and scalability problems related to blockchain applications. Then, In 2020, NFTs gained significant attention by introducing verification, interoperability, and genuine ownership of digital assets, marking a turning point in blockchain technology.

Since then, only a handful of mainstream applications utilizing blockchain have surfaced. The market downturn has become more stable, liquidity has decreased, and progress has become more steady and slow.

However, the last 11 months of 2023 have been crucial for the web3 world, signifying another phase of infrastructure development. Recognizing this momentum, [**Spheron Network**](https://spheron.network/) **organized India's first web3 infrastructure conference** [**web3:reinvent**](https://www.web3reinvent.com/) **Scheduled for December 9, 2023.** This event will bring together industry leaders, including developers, founders, VCs, and investors, to explore and engage with the future of decentralized technologies and create a solid base for upcoming years. Together, these leaders will dive into the potential and the future of web3 technologies.

## How Fast Does Web3 Infrastructure Have Capacity To Grow?

AI had its watershed moment in 2022, launching into the mainstream with widely embraced tools like [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) and other AI-based 70+ tools launched just within a month after ChatGPT launched. However, this achievement was the culmination of over 70 years of research, tracing its origins back to the 1950s. At the beginning of 1950, [John Von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) and [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) did not create the term AI but were the founding fathers of the technology behind it: Alan Turing published [“Computer Machinery and Intelligence”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence), which proposed a test of machine intelligence called The Imitation Game.

In contrast, blockchain emerged in 2008 alongside Bitcoin, marking its 15-year milestone this year. Ethereum, the foundational layer for many decentralized applications, is celebrating its eighth anniversary this year.

While the applications of blockchain technology are still in their early stages, the industry experienced substantial progress in infrastructure development in 2022. These milestone achievements demonstrate how rapidly blockchain innovation is advancing and the vast potential it holds for the future. No organization or individual has witnessed such rapid technological growth and preparation for an explosion of innovation that can transform blockchain into a robust infrastructure capable of supporting a wide range of consumer applications, including gaming, commerce, social media, the creator community, and beyond. Imagine what it can do in the upcoming 10 years.

Due to the market downturn in 2023, there's a noticeable decline, which ultimately stems from the fundamental nature of business. **However, the potential of Web3 holds the capability to transform our perception of the Internet and revolutionize various industries. The infrastructure of Web3 has the power to significantly alter the status quo for the better. It's crucial to advocate for its advancement to highlight that innovation plays a pivotal role. Web3 has the capacity to significantly enhance and uplift various facets, and it's important to promote its potential to the world.**

## web3re:invent: Spheron Network Shaping the Future of Decentralized Infra

Establishing an internet startup in the early 2000s posed significant challenges. Founders had to navigate the complexities of setting up servers, sorting out network connectivity, and constructing their app's infrastructure, all while grappling with generating revenue without a solid business model—resulting in a staggering 99% failure rate for internet businesses.

Fast forward to the emergence of cloud computing: a game-changer that revolutionized the web. It empowered developers to streamline backend architecture, allowing them to concentrate on crafting exceptional products. **Then came the Web3 Ecosystem. This shift sparked an explosion of innovation, democratizing the creation of internet products for everyone, but it has been hindered by inefficient, convoluted, and disjointed infrastructure.**

Developers currently face challenges in building web3 applications due to the complexity of integrating various solutions from multiple providers. This required dealing with several vendors, navigating legal and compliance procedures, and managing different tools that often don't work seamlessly together, leading to a cumbersome process.

**Just as standardized open protocols simplified web1 and cloud computing did for web2, there was a need for an all-in-one blockchain development solution in web3. At Spheron Network, our aim was to equip developers with a comprehensive suite of tools, streamlining the creation of web3 apps by integrating all necessary functionalities seamlessly, such as Hosting, computing and storage.**

**Over the years, Spheron diligently created a set of tools tailored for every web3 developer. Integrating difficult tech methods, stacks and technologies and transforming them into a comprehensive product solution for everyone. Our toolkit marks a significant stride in achieving the goal of growth of the web3 infrastructure. Spheron's vibrant community, comprising around 6000+ developers, over 5000+ projects, and nearly 100 startups, demonstrates its dedication to the space. All these participants are set in motion, thriving, and have found great success hosting their services on Spheron. They have harnessed the advantages that Spheron provides through their successful experiences.**

**By offering a unified stack to developers, we are drastically simplifying the web3 development process, reducing the time from months to days. This enables teams to focus more on product innovation and building exceptional applications, ultimately accelerating progress within the web3 ecosystem.**
