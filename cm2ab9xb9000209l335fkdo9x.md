[Lilypad](https://lilypad.tech/) is developing a serverless, distributed compute network that enables internet-scale data processing, AI, ML, and other arbitrary computation while unleashing idle processing power and unlocking a new marketplace for compute.

You can use Lilypad to run AI workload models, including Stable Diffusion and Stable Diffusion Video, or add your module to the Lilypad Network. Using Lilypads distributed compute nodes, you can build and run your own containerized workloads that require high-performance computing.

## **Overview**

[Lilypad](https://lilypad.tech/) provides distributed computational services underpinned by the [Bacalhau Project](https://www.bacalhau.org/). The network provides infrastructure for use cases like AI inference, ML training, DeSci, and more. Lilypad strategically collaborates with decentralized infrastructure networks, such as Filecoin, to formulate a transparent, efficient, and accessible computational ecosystem.

Perform off-chain decentralized compute over data, with on-chain guarantees. Call this functionality directly from a smart contract, CLI, and an easy to use abstraction layer.

In the video above, [Ally Haire](https://x.com/DeveloperAlly?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), Co-Founder of Lilypad, introduces the project and its goals.

The network is laying the groundwork for multi-chain integration and deploying an incentivized testnet.

Lilypad has evolved from earlier versions (v0, v1 & v2), where the network served as a proof of concept for verifiable, decentralized compute directly from smart contracts. These earlier iterations established the groundwork for a robust, scalable platform with expanded features and multichain support.

Bacalhau has been integral to Lilypad since its early versions (v0 and v1), serving as the backbone for verifiable off-chain compute. In these early iterations, Bacalhau was used for Proof of Concept projects, helping users execute decentralized compute jobs from smart contracts.

## **Objective and problem statement**

Lilypad aims to mitigate the challenges predominantly associated with the accessibility of high-performance computational hardware. Numerous barriers impede developers and organizations from smoothly integrating projects that require high-performance computing, such as AI technologies, into their applications.

Unlike conventional centralized systems, where access to powerful compute hardware is restricted and costly, Lilypad endeavors to democratize this access. Through its verifiable, trustless, and decentralized computational network, Lilypad extends unrestricted, global access to computational power. By leveraging decentralized infrastructure networks such as Filecoin, Lilypad is strategically positioned to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and accessibility of high-performance computing hardware.

## Lilypad Architecture

The architecture consists of several components:

![](https://docs.lilypad.tech/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F58337262-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FtadiyoOe4nTUoSulEVOV%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-6da1869f36cf20a02d0f47f72f1415bfb5625885%252Farch_lp_main.png%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=7cf0de7f&sv=1 align="left")

1. **Controller:** A public-facing contract that acts as the network gateway and understands a job's end-to-end workflow.
    
2. **Storage:** Stores deals, agreements, results, and disputes. Acts as a "database" for the controller contract.
    
3. **Mediation:** Starts as a "single mediator" and can be upgraded to a "consortium of mediators."
    
4. **Payments:** Manages the movement of funds for Lilypad actions and handles the escrow account in the token on behalf of jobs.
    
5. **ERC-20:** A standard ERC-20 contract with additional methods for handling escrow.
    

## Lilypad Services

![](https://docs.lilypad.tech/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F58337262-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FtadiyoOe4nTUoSulEVOV%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-2f7a42d67e7b3ed4d5c24bfb83818e3d9012395a%252Farch_lp_services.png%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=58c64097&sv=1 align="left")

1. **Mediator:** The "Ticket Inspector" that checks results if the client requests.
    
2. **Smart Contracts:** Deployed to IPC, these contracts need to be initialized by both parties to start a job.
    
3. **Job Creator:** The "Client" that posts a "Job Offer" to the solver and pays money into the smart contract as collateral.
    
4. **Solver:** Off-chain market maker that matches resource providers and job creators.
    
5. **Resource Provider:** Posts a "Resource Offer" to the solver and pays money into the smart contract as collateral against its results.
    

## **Applications**

Perform off-chain decentralized compute over data, with on-chain guarantees, and to call this functionality directly from a smart contract, CLI, API, and an easy-to-use abstraction layer opens the door to a multitude of possible applications, including:

* Inference AI jobs
    
* ML training jobs
    
* Invoking & supporting generic ZK computations
    
* Cross-chain interoperability complements to bridge protocols
    
* Utilizing inbuilt storage on IPFS
    
* Federated Learning consensus (with Bacalhau insulated jobs)
    
* IoT & Sensor Data integrations
    
* Providing a platform for Digital twins
    
* Supply chain tracking & analysis
    
* ETL & data preparation jobs
    

## **Key features of Lilypad**

Some of the key features of Lilypad include:

1. **Verifiable Serverless Decentralized Compute Network**: Lilypad is a decentralized compute network that aims to provide global, permissionless access to compute power. The Network orchestrates off-chain compute (a global GPU marketplace) and uses on-chain verification (Arbitrum L2 on Ethereum) to guarantee compute success.
    
2. **Mainstream Web3 Application Support**: Lilypad is designed to enable mainstream web3 applications to use its compute network with the [Lilypad CLI](https://docs.lilypad.tech/lilypad/lilypad-testnet/install-run-requirements) and [Smart Contracts](https://docs.lilypad.tech/lilypad/developer-resources/lilypad-smart-contracts). It aims to make decentralized AI compute more accessible, efficient, and transparent for developers and users.
    
3. **Open Compute Network**: Lilypad is an open compute network allowing users to access and run AI models/other programs in a serverless manner. Module creators and general users can access a curated set of modules or can easily create their own Lilypad module to run an AI model/other program on the network.
    
4. **Multichain Support**: The Lilypad Incentivized Testnet [first launched](https://blog.lilypadnetwork.org/lilypad-project-report-june-19-2024#heading-engineering-update) on Arbitrum in June 2024 and plans to go multi-chain in the near future. Supporting multiple blockchain networks will increase scalability and interoperability, allowing users to choose the best blockchain that suits their needs.
    
5. **Incentivized Test Net**: The [Lilypad IncentiveNet](https://lilypadnetwork.notion.site/Leap-into-Lilypad-s-IncentiveNet-9e9b12936d4340ad9417d92dab8bd9d1) is live! The IncentiveNet program provides users with [Lilybit\_ rewards](https://blog.lilypadnetwork.org/incentivenet-lilybit-reward-calculations) to participate in running nodes, testing, and improving the network. Learn more by checking out the [IncentiveNet Leaderboard](https://info.lilypad.tech/leaderboard).
    
6. **Decentralization of Mediators**: The team also aims to decentralize the mediators in the network. This means that the decision-making process and governance of the network will be distributed among multiple participants, ensuring a more decentralized and resilient system.
    

## **What is the Bacalhau Project?**

Bacalhau is a peer-to-peer computation network that enables compute-over-data jobs like GPU-enabled AI, ML, analytics, data engineering, data science, de-sci, and more. With the open-source Bacalhau Project, you can streamline your existing workflows without rewriting by running Docker containers and WebAssembly (WASM) images as tasks. This architecture is also referred to asÂ **Compute-over-Data** (or CoD).

To find out more about it, see the Bacalhau [Docs](https://docs.bacalhau.org/)!
