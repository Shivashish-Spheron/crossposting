These days, there's been an increase in using [GPU (graphics processing unit)](https://www.spheron.network/) clouds because they are simpler to set up and manage than regular CPU (central processing unit) clouds. This is especially true for projects involving artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), or other industries requiring GPU power.

Unlike typical cloud services that need flexibility and compatibility among various parts like processors, memory, and network connections, GPU clouds mainly focus on one type of task. As a result, managing these systems is much less complicated.

Many organizations prefer the [NVIDIA H100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/) model when choosing hardware for most modern applications requiring powerful computing, such as [large language model (LLM)](https://blog.spheron.network/top-15-open-source-llms-for-2024-and-their-uses) training and heavy ML/diffusion computations. Users usually only have to decide how many GPUs they require instead of worrying about other details. Although fast networking capabilities are important, spending too much money on this aspect is not a significant issue since networks tend to be cheaper than GPUs.

## CPU vs GPU Performance Analysis

Undoubtedly, tasks such as ML and DL training model development or rendering high-resolution videos can be efficiently accomplished using an on-premise GPU server, which offers many features and amenities not typically found in GPU cloud servers. It is worth noting that while a GPU-powered data center suits rudimentary modeling and training needs, the precision of computation varies across different GPU models, with some providing double-precision and others single-precision values. Therefore, it is imperative to consider the level of precision needed for accurate modeling and choose between the two accordingly.

Organizations that struggle with managing on-premise servers can greatly benefit from GPU cloud servers. By choosing cloud infrastructure with GPU-based processing, these entities gain the advantage of optimal performance, precise memory allocation, and robust disk capabilities. In contrast, deploying on-premises servers without an experienced IT team can be daunting and may result in suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, organizations must consider GPU cloud servers as a reliable and efficient alternative.

The operational reliability of GPU cloud servers surpasses that of on-premise servers in various ways. From network disruptions and equipment failures to power outages and storage constraints, on-premise servers are prone to numerous operational issues that can significantly impact their performance. On the other hand, cloud-based solutions offer greater stability and resilience as cloud service providers (CSPs) manage these servers promptly and efficiently, ensuring uninterrupted service. Therefore, opting for a cloud-based GPU solution is the best decision as it eliminates the burden of resolving the issues associated with on-premise server maintenance.

## **Why GPUs Perform Better Tasks**

## Case Studies and Examples

Case studies and examples are powerful tools for grasping how various hardware setups affect data performance. Here are a few examples:

* **NVIDIA Tesla V100:** A recent study conducted by the [University of Bristol](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/university-of-bristols-new-tesla-p100-accelerated-supercomputer/) has demonstrated that using NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs can significantly accelerate deep learning workloads for drug discovery. According to the research, GPUs boost computations by an impressive 15-20x compared to CPUs, slashing the time required to train complex models from days to just a few hours.
    
* **AWS EC2 P3 Instances:** The [AWS EC2 P3](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p3/) instances are indisputably powered by NVIDIA V100 GPUs and are unequivocally designed for machine learning and high-performance computing workloads. A decisive case study by NVIDIA unequivocally demonstrated that a company could drastically reduce the time required for image classification from 1.5 hours to 3 minutes using AWS EC2 P3 instances.

These processors can dynamically increase clock speed by leveraging advanced features like Intel Turbo Boost Technology to enhance performance. As a result, the time taken to complete such tasks can be reduced from 24 hours to just 10 minutes.
    

## Cost Analysis

It is important to note that GPU's efficiency and power performance are highly commendable despite the tradeoffs in cost and performance. One must consider the cost dynamics and operational efficiencies between CPU and GPU servers and hyperscale cloud providers like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft play a significant role in optimizing data center operations. In the case of CPU servers, the costs associated with hosting are relatively similar to the capital costs.

This difference lies in CPU and GPU server architectures and their respective costs. CPU servers typically have lower capital costs but higher hosting costs, while GPU servers exhibit the opposite trend, with higher capital costs but lower hosting costs.

Cost distribution plays a vital role in the existence of third-party cloud providers such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. These providers operate at a massive scale and have optimized their data center operations to reduce hosting costs significantly. One of the essential metrics for this optimization is the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), which measures the data center's efficiency by comparing the total energy consumed with the energy delivered to computing equipment. The lower the PUE, the more efficient the data center. Hyperscale cloud providers are experts in optimizing PUE through various means, such as efficient cooling and power delivery systems. This results in PUE values approaching as close to 1 as possible, indicating highly efficient data center operations.

When choosing between general-purpose chips and GPU servers, the decision heavily relies on factors such as the workload nature, the requirement for parallel processing, cost considerations, and overall performance needs. It's important to carefully analyze these factors, as each type of server has its own advantages and applications. However, it's worth noting that GPUs are generally the preferred choice for any high-tech-related use case due to their exceptional ability to deliver standalone performance.
