If you've been actively searching for DePIN-related content lately, you must have stumbled upon the DePIN Connection [YouTube channel by Bradley Meyer](https://links.depinhub.io/008-depin-connection?ref=blogcms.depinhub.io). Let us tell you, Brad is not just your average DePIN deployer; he is also a highly successful one. [DePIN Hub](https://depinhub.io/blog/008) recently contacted him to gain insights into his journey, what drives him, and his advice for those who aspire to follow in his footsteps. The $50K newsletter title is undoubtedly the real deal, as we'll soon discover below.¬†

### **From Quarantine to Success**

In 2020, Brad found himself in a 14-day quarantine and took advantage of the extra time to delve into the blockchain world. After discovering Helium, he set up shop in the DePIN space and became a successful entrepreneur. A long-term Hotspotty customer, Brad used their services to manage, optimize, and scale his Helium hotspot operations. Thanks to [Hotspotty](https://links.depinhub.io/008-hotspotty-website?ref=blogcms.depinhub.io), Brad now runs 4 DePIN business lines, 3 built around deployments with impressive installation and fleet stats. The 4th line is focused on his DePIN YouTube channel, which has also contributed to his success.

* Helium (60 rooftop installs) üì°
    
* DIMO (170 vehicles connected) üöó
    
* Hivemapper (55 full-time drivers) üó∫Ô∏è
    

### **DePIN Earning Deployments**

Brad's hobby has grown into a highly profitable business, earning him around $40-50k monthly across his DePIN projects. However, it is crucial for any deployer to thoroughly research a project's tokenomics and understand the implications of reward distributions.¬†

Predicting earnings can be tricky, especially when working at scale for popular projects with extended delivery backorders.¬†

To achieve growth in DePIN deployment, [fleet management's hosting model](https://links.depinhub.io/008-hotspotty-fleet-management?ref=blogcms.depinhub.io) is a crucial component. Brad initially scaled his Helium operations through Hotspotty's best-in-class fleet management software. Referrals have played a significant role in his growth, with approximately 40% of his hosts referred by other hosts.¬†

### **Evaluating DePIN Projects**

When it comes to choosing a [DePIN project](https://links.depinhub.io/008-depinhub-projects?ref=blogcms.depinhub.io) to invest your time and money into, the abundance of options can make it difficult to find the right one. However, Brad's 4-step checklist can help you evaluate potential projects with confidence.¬†  

1. **Utility:** What is the use case? How much revenue can the project generate? What is the differentiator that will capture market share?
    
2. **Participation:** Who is the target audience? What are the barriers to entry? Can the project gain enough participation to generate the necessary infrastructure or data?
    
3. **Team:** Are they doxxed? Do they have proof they can execute?
    
4. **Tokenomics:** How are the tokens distributed between the participants, the team, investors, and other categories? Are there any red flags?
    

It's not just Brad who has benefited from the DePIN projects. Many others, such as [5 Mile Trucker](https://twitter.com/acouplenomads), have also seen significant success. 5 Mile Trucker has driven an impressive 1.8 million safe miles and earns money through the [Natix network](https://www.natix.network/). This highlights the potential for profitability in the DePIN space and the variety of opportunities available to those involved.
