Decentralized physical infrastructure networks, also known as DePINs, will undoubtedly play a significant role in the near future. As concerns about the management of AI systems continue to rise, their influence will only expand. It's high time we all become familiar with this topic and start discussing it more openly.

## A growing vertical in blockchain technology

A Growing Blockchain Vertical DePINs are the future of physical infrastructure coordination. With blockchain-powered networks and token incentives, it democratizes access to essential resources like energy, compute, wireless connectivity, and AI. [**Over 750 DePIN**](https://depin.ninja/projects)**ventures are already serving an array of use cases on various blockchains, with a market cap of almost $56 billion.** It's time to embrace DePINs and revolutionize how we access and operate physical infrastructure.

That figure's value is insignificant compared to the immense potential that DePIN holds for the future. According to a recent [**report by Messari**](https://messari.io/report-pdf/f125632168e9a04e016fe43bc551f412389eda4f.pdf), which presents the current status of DePIN, the technology has numerous advantages over the centralized infrastructures it aims to replace. These advantages include community-driven capital expenditure, reduced administrative overheads due to on-chain settlement, and a flourishing culture of experimentation and innovation.

**According to Messari's researchers, the DePIN flywheel has the potential to contribute more than $10 trillion to the global GDP within the next decade, with a whopping $100 trillion in the following decade. This is a bold statement, given that the current crypto market cap is just over $2 trillion. However, it's important to note that DePIN revenues are not based on speculation but on utility, which makes it easy to see the enormous potential of this technology.**

To put it simply, the majority of individuals invest in cryptocurrency with the aim of making a profit. However, those participating in DePIN are rewarded for lending their computing resources. This results in a more concrete value exchange and less risk involved. Additionally, there is a selfless aspect to DePIN as contributors work towards improving public infrastructure for the betterment of society.

The DePIN project [Helium](https://www.helium.com/) is making waves with its peer-to-peer wireless network. It incentivizes contributors to become node operators by deploying Helium hotspot devices and extending the network's coverage. **With a valuation of**[**$1.2 billion**](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/02/18/crypto-powered-wireless-network-helium-raises-200m-at-12b-valuation-report/)**and a whopping $370 million raised over eight funding rounds, Helium is owned and operated by community members. In December, it added over 20,000 new subscribers, solidifying its position as a major player in the wireless network space.**

DePIN has many use cases, one of which is decentralized wireless, or DeWi. But that's not all. Decentralized computing is another promising application of DePIN, as exemplified by [Akash Network](https://akash.network/) and [Spheron Network](https://www.spheron.network/). The logistics sector also benefits from DePIN technology, as evidenced by [HEALE](https://healelabs.com/). According to Messari researchers, it is highly likely that in the next two decades, DePIN will have a corresponding application for every industry.

## Exploring the Revolutionary World of Computing and DePINs

DePINs will significantly impact spatial computing, an umbrella term for human-computer interactions in the real world rather than through a screen. Using AR/MR technologies, spatial computing combines physical and virtual experiences. Additionally, it allows machines, such as robots, drones, and industrial equipment, to gather sensor data and learn about their physical surroundings to recognize patterns, optimize, and automate human processes.

The era of spatial computing has finally arrived, and [Apple's Vision Pro headset](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/) clearly indicates that. With the ability to blend digital content with the physical world, this device has the potential to revolutionize every industry, from aerospace and healthcare to manufacturing and construction. And, even though Apple may be focusing on consumer hardware, the possibilities for spatial computing are limitless.

The blockchain ecosystem has developed various exchanges and market makers, making setting up international reward networks incredibly effortless. The traditional banking ecosystem would have made this task very arduous, but with smart contracts and wallets, it has become a hassle-free process.

If you spend any time in crypto, you'll undoubtedly come across the phrase, "We're still early." This maxim is equally applicable to DePIN initiatives like Helium, which have the potential to fundamentally transform the way critical infrastructure is managed and accessed by the general public.
