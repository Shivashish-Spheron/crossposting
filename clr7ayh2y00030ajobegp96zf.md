[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) is an open-source time series database used for storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, Internet of Things sensor data, and real-time analytics. Deploying an InfluxDB instance is now easier than ever, thanks to Spheron Compute. This step-by-step guide will walk you through easily deploying InfluxDB in just a few clicks. With Spheron, you can forget about the headaches of manual configurations and focus on what matters most - your data.

Whether you're a blockchain enthusiast, developer, or organization looking to participate in network validation, this quick deployment method will get you up and running without the hassle of manual configurations.

## **What is Spheron Network?**

[Spheron Network](https://spheron.network/) is a next-generation PaaS that offers low-cost and seamless access to Web3 infrastructure across multiple chains. It is explicitly designed to serve a broader audience, including startups, developers, and organizations looking to scale their infrastructure.

Spheron Network offers a [Compute Marketplace](https://docs.spheron.network/marketplace-guide/) that you can use to set up useful tools like InfluxDB quickly. With Spheron, you don't have to worry about the technical stuff, and you can focus on deploying your InfluxDB instance with ease. In addition to compute, web hosting, and storage capabilities, Spheron offers many features to enhance productivity and enable stakeholders to reach new heights while prioritizing privacy, security, and reliability.

## **How to deploy InfluxDB using Spheron Compute?**

You can follow these steps to deploy InfluxDB on Spheron Compute.

### **Step 1: Create a Free Spheron Network Account**

1. Visit Spheron Network: [https://spheron.network/](https://docs.spheron.network/compute/cluster/#advanced-configuration)
    
2. On the Spheron homepage, locate and click the "Free Trial" button.
    
3. You'll be directed to a login/signup page. Choose your preferred authentication method: Web2 (GitHub account, GitLab account, or Bitbucket account) or Web3 (Ethereum).
    
4. Follow the provided prompts to authenticate your chosen account securely. This step ensures safe access to the Spheron Network platform.
    
5. After successful authentication, you'll be guided to a confirmation page confirming the completion of your account setup.
    

### **Step 2: Creating an Organization**

1. Upon logging in, navigate to the "Compute" section using the dropdown on the top right corner.
    
2. You'll be prompted to create your organization's name, username, and Avatar. Add and click “Save.”
    
3. Next, you'll be taken to a new page. Click the "New Cluster" button.
    

### **Step 3: Deploying InfluxDB With Spheron Platform UI**

Follow these steps to deploy InfluxDB:

1\. Choose "Compute" to use CPU-based instances for running containers.

2\. Choose the type of compute you need from the options under "Compute Type." You can pick the one that suits your requirements. 

**NOTE:** Please schedule a team call to gain early access to the On Demand Type.

3\. Select "Import from Docker Hub".

4\. Enter the names for your cluster and docker image. Then, Add the tag and Click "Next."

5\. Select your preferred region for deployment. The container will be deployed in any region for Spot or in the EU-east region for On Demand. Choosing a region closer to your users can improve performance and reduce latency. Spheron offers the following regions to choose from for Spot:

* US-east
    
* US-west
    
* US-central
    
* EU-west
    
* Any
    

**NOTE:** It is recommended to select any region for Spot to get a higher chance of successful deployment, as it will deploy on any providers in the network.

6\. Next, Choose an instance plan that aligns with your requirements. You can use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your CPU-based instance.

7\. Next, Configure storage:  
You have to choose Storage from the available options. This storage will be volatile storage and is erased when the instance is restarted, redeployed, or shut down.

Additionally, you get the option to choose Persistent Storage. Persistent storage will not be erased unless the instance is closed. If choosing persistent storage, specify the type of storage (HDD, SSD, NVMe) and Add mount point.

8\. Create new Port Policy Mapping. Add the container port, and Select the exposed port to which you want to map it.

9\. Add environment variables, if any.

10\. For advanced configurations, feel free to explore more options. Just [click here](https://docs.spheron.network/compute/cluster/#advanced-configuration) to learn more about these advanced settings.

11\. Once you're all set, click "Deploy" to start the deployment process. It's as simple as that!

That's it! Your InfluxDB instance will now be deployed.

**NOTE:** Remember to access InfluxDB only after the Compute Instance is provisioned. So, allow some time for the installation to complete before you can use it.

## **Connecting to InfluxDB**

* As the node starts, the Instance Logs display output about the operations performed. If you see messages that blocks are being proposed and finalized, you have a running node.
    
* To interact with your InfluxDB, use the Connection URL provided by Spheron under Port Policy Info for port 8086.
