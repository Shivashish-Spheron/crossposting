## **1\. The Evolution of Swan Chain**

**Q1: How did Swan Chain evolve from FilSwan?  
Prakarsh**: So, Swan Chain started as **FilSwan**. Can you tell us about the shift from **FilSwan** to Swan Chain?

**Jean-Luc**: Absolutely. The rebrand happened naturally as we evolved. **FilSwan** initially represented our roots in the Filecoin ecosystem. However, as Charles, our founder, kept building, it became clear that we needed more control and flexibility, which led to the creation of our own Layer 2 chain. So, it made sense to evolve into Swan Chain to reflect this independence and the broader capabilities we were developing.

## **2\. The Rise of AI and Swan Chain’s Entry**

**Q2: Why did Swan Chain expand into the AI space?  
Prakarsh**: With the boom in AI over the past few years, why did Swan Chain expand into the AI space?

**Jean-Luc**: Great question. Since our inception in 2021, the demand for AI has exploded. AI is no longer just a buzzword; it’s an essential component of modern technology. We saw a natural alignment between our decentralized compute capabilities and the needs of AI startups. AI companies are now the biggest consumers of compute power, and Swan Chain is positioned perfectly to cater to that demand.

## **3\. The Synergy of AI and Blockchain**

**Q3: How does Swan Chain leverage the synergy between AI and blockchain?  
Prakarsh**: Can you explain how Swan Chain leverages the synergy between AI and blockchain?

**Jean-Luc**: Swan Chain enhances both technologies. Blockchain adds security and transparency to AI by providing immutable data and enabling decentralized data sharing, while AI optimizes blockchain operations by analyzing data, automating processes, and improving decision-making. Together, they create a powerful combination that drives innovation and makes data more trustworthy and accessible.

## **4\. The Decentralized AI Compute Marketplace**

**Q4: How does Swan Chain’s decentralized AI compute marketplace work?  
Prakarsh**: Swan Chain is building a decentralized AI compute marketplace. How does that work in practice?

**Jean-Luc**: Our decentralized compute marketplace is managed by an orchestrator, acting as a matchmaking engine between supply and demand. Builders can use Swan to scale their AI startups rapidly and cost-effectively. It’s about matching the needs of AI projects with available compute resources across the network, ensuring a fair and efficient process.

## **5\. Tackling Decentralized Storage**

**Q5: What is Swan Chain’s approach to decentralized storage?  
Prakarsh**: Decentralized storage is another big focus area for Swan Chain. What are you doing differently in this space?

**Jean-Luc**: Decentralized storage tackles many limitations of traditional storage systems, especially for large AI datasets. It offers greater scalability, improved security, and cost-effectiveness by distributing data across multiple nodes. We’ve already processed vast amounts of data—reportedly double what CERN has processed, which puts our capabilities into perspective.

## **6\. The Swan Ecosystem**

**Q6: What other products and teams are part of the Swan ecosystem?  
Prakarsh**: What’s the current state of Swan Chain’s ecosystem? Are there any other products or teams within the Swan umbrella?

**Jean-Luc**: Swan Chain is part of the Nebula AI family, which includes projects like Nebula Block, Fog Meta, and Helix Mesh. Nebula Block bridges Web2 companies into the Web3 space, while Multistorage handles various aspects of our ecosystem, from storage solutions to UI/UX optimization. We’re constantly expanding, with around 50 developers across Toronto, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and beyond.

## **7\. Universal Basic Income (UBI) Model**

**Q7: How does SwanChain implement the UBI model?  
Prakarsh**: You mentioned a focus on building a universal basic income (UBI) model within SwanChain. Can you elaborate on that?

**Jean-Luc**: The UBI model is one of my favorite components of our ecosystem. It rewards anyone providing compute resources to the network, even if their resources aren’t currently in use. It’s a small, consistent reward just for being part of the ecosystem, which encourages more people to participate and helps us scale towards competing with giants like AWS and Google.

## **8\. Roadmap and Future Vision**

**Q8: What does the roadmap look like for Swan Chain?  
Prakarsh**: What’s the roadmap for Swan Chain in the coming months?

**Jean-Luc**: We’re gearing up for our token generation event (TGE) in Q4 2024, focusing on growing our community and further developing our ecosystem. We’ve also applied for a major grant from the Optimism ecosystem, which, if successful, will boost our capacity to support more projects building on Swan Chain. It’s an exciting time for us!

## **9\. Looking Ahead: SwanChain in the Next Six Years**

**Q9: Where do you see SwanChain in six years?  
Prakarsh**: As we wrap up, where do you see Swan Chain in the next six years?

**Jean-Luc**: We aim to be a major player, not just in Web3 but also in traditional tech sectors. In six years, I envision a future where Swan Chain and similar platforms are integral to the tech landscape, where blockchain and AI become standard, seamless, and indistinguishable from the broader internet.

**Prakarsh**: That’s a vision worth pursuing! Thanks so much for sharing your insights, Jean-Luc. Swan Chain is doing groundbreaking work, and we’re excited to follow your journey.

**Jean-Luc**: Thanks for having me, Prakarsh. Always a pleasure to discuss the future of tech and how we’re shaping it. To everyone listening, stay tuned and keep exploring what decentralized AI can offer!
