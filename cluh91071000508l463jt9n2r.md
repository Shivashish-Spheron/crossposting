In an ever-evolving digital landscape, change is the only constant. As part of our commitment to innovation and providing the best possible solutions to our users, **we've made the difficult decision to retire our static site deployment service effective June 1st, 2024. This move is designed to streamline our services and focus on areas where we can deliver the most value to our users.**

## **Why Are We Making This Change?**

The decision to sunset our static site deployment service was not made lightly. Over the years, this service has helped countless users deploy and manage their static websites efficiently. However, as the web development ecosystem evolves, we find it increasingly important to focus our resources and efforts on services that can best meet our user's current and future needs.

## **What This Means for You**

**If you are currently using our static site deployment service, you will need to migrate your sites to another platform by June 1st, 2024. After this date, the service will no longer be available, and access to your site data on our platform will be discontinued.**

## **Steps to Migrate Your Site**

1. **Evaluate Alternative Platforms**: Start by researching alternative static site hosting services. When choosing a new platform, consider factors such as ease of use, pricing, scalability, and support.
    
2. **Plan Your Migration**: Develop a migration plan that includes backing up your site, transferring your domain (if applicable), and setting up your site on the new platform. Ensure to test your site thoroughly on the new platform before making the switch.
    
3. **Update Your DNS Settings**: Once your site is set up with the new service, update your DNS settings to point to your new hosting provider. This will make sure that your visitors are directed to your new site location.
    
4. **Communicate with Your Users**: Inform your site visitors about the move in advance. This can be done through website banners, email notifications, or social media announcements.
