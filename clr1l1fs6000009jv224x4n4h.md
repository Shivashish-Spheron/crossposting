[Substrate](https://substrate.io/) empowers developers to easily create custom blockchains, providing a flexible and modular foundation for blockchain applications. Deploying a Substrate Node on the Akash Network is now easier than ever, thanks to Spheron Compute.

This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process, allowing you to set up your Substrate Node within minutes. Whether you're a blockchain enthusiast, developer, or organization looking to participate in network validation, this quick deployment method will get you up and running without the hassle of manual configurations.

## What is Substrate?

Substrate is a powerful blockchain framework designed to create customized and autonomous blockchains with minimal effort. Launching a blockchain is the quickest way since developers don't need to worry about essential components like networking, data layer, transaction queue, and consensus. With Substrate, projects can be easily upgraded using modular components called pallets tailored to specific needs.

This framework offers flexibility and modularity, allowing developers to choose between technical freedom and ease of development at different stages of blockchain development. Unlike some other frameworks, Substrate supports on-chain upgrades, enabling modifications to smart contracts without the restrictions faced by Ethereum's smart contracts, which cannot be changed once deployed.

## **What is Spheron Network?**

[**Spheron Network**](https://spheron.network/) is a Web3 infrastructure platform that provides tools and services to decentralize cloud storage and computing. It allows audited data centers to join the Spheron marketplace. Spheron oversees the decentralized and governed nature of the infrastructure, ensuring permissionless access and heightened security for all users. **Spheron Compute offers a feature-rich alternative to traditional cloud services at only one-third of the cost.**

Spheron offers a [**Compute Marketplace**](https://docs.spheron.network/marketplace-guide), which allows users to set up valuable tools quickly and easily, whether they want to deploy databases, nodes, tools, or AI. With Spheron, you don't have to worry about the technical stuff, and you can focus on deploying your Node with ease. Spheron Network has also partnered with organizations like [**Shardeum**](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-and-stake-a-shardeum-validator-on-spheron-in-minutes), [**Avail**](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-an-avail-node-in-minutes-using-spheron-compute), [**Elixir**](https://blog.spheron.network/step-by-step-guide-to-launching-an-elixir-node-with-spheron), [**Filecoin**](https://filecoin.io/), [**Arbitrum**](https://arbitrum.io/), etc, to redefine access to it and promote a more decentralized, inclusive, and community-centric ecosystem.

**Spheron provides features such as Private images, Auto-scale instances, Scale on demand, Real-time instance metrics, Faster GPUs, Free Bandwidths, Terraform Providers and SDKs, Instance health checks, activity, shell access, and more.

2. **Forkless Upgrades:**
    
    * Substrate facilitates seamless and automatic upgrades to blockchain runtimes, allowing projects to update their rules without disrupting continuity.
        
3. **Customization for Applications:**
    
    * The flexibility of Substrate allows for customization of various aspects, such as fee payment logic and transaction pools. This is particularly beneficial for projects that require tailored transaction handling.
        
4. **EVM Support and Interoperability:**
    
    * Substrate's EVM pallet supports EVM & Solidity smart contracts, fostering compatibility with existing contracts and developers. Interoperability within a broader ecosystem is highlighted.
        
5. **Multi Virtual Machines and Scalability:**
    
    * Substrate's support for multiple virtual machines, including WebAssembly and EVM, is crucial for the next-generation smart contract platforms, promoting interoperability between virtual machines.
        
6. **Interoperability and Asset Expansion:**
    
    * Substrate enables projects to connect to various blockchain networks, expanding the range of available assets. This interconnected approach eliminates the need for users to manage liquidity across different protocols.
        
7. **Tooling and Off-Chain Workers:**
    
    * Substrate's off-chain worker functionality is a valuable tool for speeding up chain processes and offloading business logic, contributing to the efficiency of decentralized applications.
        
8. **Custom Consensus Layer without Compromising Core Functionalities:**
    
    * Substrate empowers the system to add a custom consensus layer to its node without impacting core functionalities like finality and block production. This customization is crucial to the system's architecture and impossible without Substrate's flexibility and capabilities.
