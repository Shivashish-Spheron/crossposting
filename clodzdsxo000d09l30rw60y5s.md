Spheron and AR.IO are thrilled to announce their innovative partnership aimed at redefining access to the [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) gateway and promoting a more decentralized, inclusive, and community-centric ecosystem. This partnership is set to inspire widespread community involvement, reward participation, and elevate the [AR.IO](https://ar.io/) community's experience by enabling the gateway to soar in the decentralized skies of bare metals.

[AR.IO](https://ar.io/) is a network of decentralized gateways and permanent domains for the Arweave ecosystem. [Spheron Network](https://spheron.network/), on the other hand, is leading the charge in providing effortless access to Web3 infrastructure. This powerful partnership promises to transform the landscape of decentralized application development, ushering in a new era of innovation and possibility.

## Partnership Details

The partnership between Spheron and [AR.IO](https://ar.io/) is more than just a union of two entities; it's the convergence of creative thinkers. Together, we are embarking on a journey to reshape the Arweave gateway, moving away from the restriction of conventional working.

[AR.IO](https://ar.io/)'s gateways act as the front door to the permaweb, offering efficient data retrieval to the larger Arweave ecosystem. In our alliance, Spheron supercharges this initiative by enabling the gateway to transcend the confines of conventional centralized cloud services.

Spheron is not only unlocking the gateway to decentralized bare metals & bringing gateways closer to users but also simplifying the node-launching process. By aligning seamlessly with the strong principles of Web3, we aim to create a network where no centralized entity can wield absolute control. This is a significant move towards decentralization, and we invite the community to actively participate in building a more decentralized permaweb infrastructure.

**We will also incentivize participation by offering $50 worth of credits to all testnet participants for the OnDemand Access.** We believe that sustained decentralization goes beyond providing the tools to run a gateway. Therefore, we are working on testing network gateways and implementing incentivization strategies to enhance network resilience and promote wider participation.

## A One-Click Wonder

Our teams are synergizing to craft a platform where launching becomes a breeze and ease with a one-click wonder. We are paving the way for effortless engagement and active participation, even for those who are not tech wizards. Join us as we navigate the exciting lanes of opportunity and innovation.

## About [AR.IO](https://ar.io/)

[AR.IO](https://ar.io/) is a global network, protocol, and currency that enables the permaweb. It is the decentralized and incentivized gateway node network of the Arweave ecosystem. Comprised of operators, developers, and end users, this community-governed network leverages a utility that has taken to proliferate access to the permaweb: the files, applications, web pages, and data permanently stored on the Arweave decentralized storage network.
