As we celebrate International Women’s Day in March 2024, the theme "Invest in women: Accelerate progress" reverberates with immense power within the Web3 and tech industries. Despite some progress, the persistent lack of gender diversity must be addressed as a significant challenge, with women often confined to non-technical roles. This disparity, rooted in historical imbalances, hampers innovation and inclusivity.

However, women significantly impact Web3, playing vital roles in advocacy, research, and community development. Embracing this year’s theme, investing in women is necessary and expected to drive innovation, promote inclusivity, and advance equity and prosperity for all in various sectors.

## Gender diversity problem in Web3 and tech industries

According to [BairesDevBlog](https://www.bairesdev.com/blog/women-in-technology-key-statistics/), women are significantly underrepresented in big tech. At Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Google, and Microsoft, women comprise **45%, 37%, 34%, 33%, and 29% of the workforce**. Their presence in leadership positions is even lower, with women holding **29%, 34%, 31%, 28%, and 26%** of these roles, respectively. The disparity becomes even more pronounced in technical positions.

The lack of gender diversity in the crypto space and the tech industry is a persisting issue that cannot be ignored. Despite the so-called efforts of these industries, the numbers speak for themselves, and they paint a stark and unacceptable picture. While the proportion of females in Web3 companies is only a meager 27%, the majority of them occupy non-technical roles. According to [Boston Consulting Group’s](https://www.bcg.com/press/16february2023-women-are-being-shut-out-of-web3) 2023 research, women are still underrepresented in technical positions. Deloitte's findings also confirm that women make up only 25% of tech professionals, highlighting the uphill battle for gender equality in the tech industry.

It's time to recognize the issue at hand - the lack of female representation in Web3 is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. This disparity has far-reaching consequences that can affect everything from product development to user interfaces and the adoption of Web3 innovations by the wider Web2 community. If we don't take action, there's a risk that products may inadvertently cater more to male perspectives, potentially alienating a significant portion of users.

The root of this problem is a complex web of factors deeply rooted in historical imbalances within the tech industry. The lack of female representation in decision-making roles only perpetuates biases and limits diverse perspectives. It's high time we addressed these issues and broke down fundamental barriers to create an environment where women can thrive in Web3 and technology.

Moreover, women in the Web3 and tech industries face numerous obstacles to accessing investment and funding, and they often encounter online discrimination. Underrepresentation in leadership roles hampers diverse viewpoints and inclusive decision-making, ultimately limiting the potential benefits of these innovations for everyone.

It's not just about equality; it's about unlocking the full potential of these innovations for everyone. We must dedicate time to address these challenges and create a better and more inclusive future for the Web3 community.

## Influence of women in Web3

From the outset of the crypto industry, women have been instrumental in developing numerous projects, communities, and brands in this space. However, their participation in launching Web3 companies has been lacking. Bitget's research reveals that less than [9% of Web3 firms](https://cointelegraph.com/news/web3-vc-funding-gender-disparity-report) in the sector were founded by women-led startups in 2023.

![](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-01/3e7ca486-0674-44db-8341-e84a7b9b8126.png align="center")

Achieving gender parity in the Web3 ecosystem requires recognizing the diverse leadership roles available to women, which was previously considered a distant goal. It is noteworthy that within this 9%, women have played critical roles in various leadership and founding positions at Web3 companies, including CEOs, founders, and C-level executives. Women lead the strategic direction, oversee financial, operational, and technological aspects, and ensure the company's fiscal health and sustainability.

The impact of female involvement in executive roles on companies has been proven to be positive. Based on a [2019 analysis by McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/diversity%20and%20inclusion/diversity%20wins%20how%20inclusion%20matters/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters-vf.pdf), firms in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams with female leadership were 25% more likely to achieve above-average profitability compared to those in the fourth quartile.

The emergence of Web3 is paving the way for women to take on diverse roles and make significant contributions to the growth of emerging sectors. With new opportunities arising, women are seizing the chance to reshape industries and make their mark in this new landscape.

## The Influence of Women in the Tech Industry

Women have played a crucial role in the evolution of technology, yet it's alarming that their representation in the sector remains unacceptably low. Despite possessing equal levels of ambition, women face unique obstacles that impede their advancement towards tech leadership roles.

[In 2020, Accenture's research](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/a-com-migration/pdf/pdf-134/accenture-a4-gwc-report-final1.pdf) revealed that the proportion of women in tech had decreased over the years, which is an alarming trend. However, the tech industry's demand for skilled professionals continues to soar. With technology permeating every facet of our lives, roles such as data scientists and software developers have become increasingly pivotal. Women can directly influence the development and adoption of innovative tools in the tech industry, and their contribution is vital to reaching a broader audience. Women can occupy various roles and make a significant impact in tech, and it's high time we ensure that they are given equal opportunities to do so.

### Product managers

Women in product management don't just lead cross-functional teams. They also drive technological developments and promote inclusive innovation in the tech sector. By developing solutions that cater to the varied needs of global audiences, they are shaping the future of product management. According to [Zippia’s statistics, in 2021, 34.7% of product managers in the U.S](https://www.zippia.com/product-manager-jobs/demographics/). were female. It's time to recognize the immense contribution of women in product management and empower more women to take on leadership roles in the industry.

## Benefits of Pursuing Careers in Web3 and Tech for Women

Web3 and tech jobs offer a wide range of benefits that appeal to many female professionals, including creativity, high compensation, and unique advantages. In fact, [KuCoin's survey of 2022](https://www.kucoin.com/blog/kucoin-survey-reveals-that-females-are-showing-great-potential-in-driving-the-development-of-web-3) shows that 60% of female professionals recognize and appreciate these advantages, indicating a high level of satisfaction within these industries.

### Job security

The Web3 and tech industries provide job security to women and are considered one of the most stable fields. According to an analysis by CompTIA of data from the U.S. [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.comptia.org/newsroom/press-releases/tech-industry-employment-grows-for-second-straight-month-job-postings-for-future-hiring-rebound-comptia-analysis-reveals) for January 2024, the unemployment rate in the tech industry is lower than the overall unemployment rate, ranging between 2.3% and 3.7%.
