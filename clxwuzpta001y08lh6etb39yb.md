Intel is making significant strides in AI, potentially becoming a formidable competitor to Nvidia. In April, at the [Intel Vision 2024 event](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/events/on-event-series/vision.html) in Phoenix, Arizona, the company introduced the initial architectural details of its third-generation AI accelerator, [Gaudi 3.](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/ai-accelerators/gaudi3.html)

Previous iterations of Gaudi received some criticism, which Intel claims have been addressed in this latest version. Gaudi 3 focuses on performance with large language models (LLMs) and boasts substantial improvements. Meanwhile, discussions around Nvidia’s upcoming GPU, the [Blackwell B200](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing), continue. Gaudi 3 is scheduled for launch in the third quarter of 2024, with samples already being sent to customers.

## Comparing Gaudi Chip Generations

[![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719467607861/0d7dcc36-5397-4e51-bd93-21ec12b2a71d.png align="center")](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/817486/intel-gaudi-3-ai-accelerator-white-paper.html)

Gaudi 3 builds on the foundation laid by Gaudi 2, enhancing various aspects. Unlike Gaudi 2’s single-chip design, Gaudi 3 features two identical silicon dies connected by a high-speed link, doubling the architecture. Each die includes a 48-megabyte cache memory at its center, surrounded by four matrix multiplication engines and 32 tensor processor cores. These elements are interconnected with memory, complemented by media processing and network infrastructure.

Intel has transitioned from TSMC’s 7nm process used in Gaudi 2 to a 5nm process for Gaudi 3, allowing for hardware improvements. Gaudi 3 now features 4 Matrix Math Engines and 32 Tensor Cores, compared to Gaudi 2’s 2 Matrix Math Engines and 24 Tensor Cores. The tensor cores in Gaudi 3 remain similar, functioning as 256-byte-wide VLIW SIMD units.

Intel claims this configuration doubles the AI compute power of Gaudi 2, leveraging 8-bit floating point infrastructure essential for training transformer models. Furthermore, computations using the BFloat16 number format see a fourfold performance increase.

## Gaudi 3 LLM Performance vs. Nvidia Hopper Series

Intel has consistently emphasized performance over specifications with the Gaudi accelerators, and Gaudi 3 is no exception. At the Vision event, Intel aimed to impress business clients with benchmark performance figures.

The Gaudi team directly compared their benchmarks with Nvidia’s reported figures to provide an unbiased comparison. However, these projections are not from assembled systems, as Intel is unlikely to have 8192 Gaudi 3 units available for testing.

In comparison to the H100, Intel suggests Gaudi 3 could surpass it by up to 1.7 times in [training Llama2–13B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b) in a 16-accelerator cluster at FP8 precision. Even though the H100 is nearly two years old, significantly outperforming it in training would be a notable achievement for Intel if confirmed.

Additionally, Intel anticipates Gaudi 3 delivering 1.3 to 1.5 times the inference performance of the H200/H100, with up to 2.3 times the power efficiency. However, Gaudi 3 occasionally falls short of H100 in certain inference workloads, especially those without 2K outputs, meaning it doesn’t achieve complete dominance. There are also other benchmark results that Intel does not emphasize.

Intel is one of the few major hardware manufacturers providing MLPerf results recently. Despite Gaudi 3’s actual performance, Intel has transparently published results for industry-standard tests.

Looking forward, with [Moore’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) in mind, the main question is the technology the next Gaudi version, Falcon Shores, will use. So far, Intel has used TSMC technology while developing its foundry business. Next year, Intel will offer its 18A technology to foundry customers and use 20A internally, introducing the next generation of transistor technology called nanosheets, with power delivery from the backside. TSMC plans to adopt this combination in 2026.

## Conclusion

Intel’s Gaudi 3 AI Accelerator marks a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial improvements in processing power, memory bandwidth, and energy efficiency. The developer's widespread acclaim and strong partnership backing underscore its transformative potential. Gaudi 3 exemplifies Intel’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI acceleration, playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of AI applications.
