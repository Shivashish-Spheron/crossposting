The expansion of the web3 ecosystem is rapid, encompassing solo developers, self-funded initiatives, and tech behemoths. Regardless of your position or the development stage of your web3 project, a robust set of web3 development tools is essential.

Understanding the web3 development stack and having access to it can streamline development timelines and ensure the reliability and resilience of your solution.

But what exactly constitutes a web3 stack, and how is it utilized?

This article delves into the definition of a web3 stack, dissecting its various layers, the tools employed in each phase, and recommending essential tools to construct effective web3 solutions.

## What is web3 stack?

The Web3 stack refers to the collection of technologies, tools, and protocols that developers use to build, operate, and maintain applications on decentralized networks, primarily blockchain networks. It's a holistic setup for building decentralized applications (dApps) and comprises layers for blockchain interaction, smart contract development, decentralized storage, and user interfaces 3.

The Web3 stack is typically divided into two main layers:

* **Network Layer:** This is the base of the Web3 technology stack. It's built on top of blockchain architectures for trustless and permissionless access. Developers have two primary choices when picking a blockchain network for building dApps: [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/)\-compatible blockchains and non-EVM-compatible blockchains.
    
* **Application Layer:** This layer ranges across various dApp categories such as DeFi, NFTs, Identity & Authentication, and Data & Analytics. It primarily allows public consumers to easily interact with an intuitive front-end, giving them the power to leverage the decentralized internet in their everyday lives.
    

## Network Layer in Web3 Development

The network layer constitutes the foundation of the Web3 development stack, housing various blockchains where developers can construct their applications. Unlike the centralized nature of servers and databases in Web2 applications, blockchains in Web3 store dApps' business logic and updated states while being decentralized and managed by distributed nodes globally, free from single-entity control.

### EVM-Compatible Blockchains

Ethereum pioneered smart contract and dApp development within blockchain technology through its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Any blockchain that integrates this runtime environment is deemed EVM-compatible. While sharing the software layer with Ethereum (Solidity), these blockchains may differ in consensus mechanisms and transaction speeds. The EVM ecosystem boasts the largest user and developer base among dApp ecosystems, making it a preferred choice.

Notable EVM-compatible layer-1 chains (apart from Ethereum) encompass:

* [Binance Smart Chain (BSC)](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/smartChain)
    
* [Polygon (MATIC)](https://polygon.technology/) 
    
* [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/)
    
* [xDAI Chain](https://www.gnosis.io/)
    
* [RSK](https://dev.rootstock.io/rif/rns/tools/Web3/)
    
* [Velas](https://velas.com/en)

* [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/)
    
* [Evmos](https://evmos.org/)
    
* [Dymension](https://dymension.xyz/)
    
* [Venom](https://www.venom.ventures/)
    

### Layer-2 Blockchains

[Layer-2 solutions](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/layer-2) (L2s) serve as secondary blockchains constructed atop layer-1 networks to enhance scalability or introduce new features. They process multiple transactions off-chain and relay transaction data to the underlying blockchain, inheriting its security features.

Prominent layer-2 blockchains encompass

* [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/)
    
* [Immutable X (IMX)](https://www.immutable.com/)
