### **Step 3: Deploying a BEVM Node With Spheron Platform UI**

Follow these steps to deploy a BEVM Node:

1\. Choose **"Compute"** to use CPU-based instances for running containers.

2\. Choose your desired Compute Type option under Compute Type.

**NOTE:** Please schedule a team call to gain early access to the **"Spot"** Type.

3\. Click **"Start from Marketplace App"** and Select **"BEVM Validator Node"** from the marketplace.

4\. **Select Region:** Select your preferred region for deployment. Choosing a region closer to you. This can improve performance and reduce latency. **US-West has a higher chance of deploying everything successfully. You can start from the US-West option.**

5\. Next, Choose an instance plan that aligns with your requirements. Spheron will recommend a suitable plan according to the BEVM template, but you can customize it from available plans or choose to **'Create Custom Plans.'**

6\. Next, Configure storage:  
You have to choose **storage** from the available options or the custom storage option that fits your needs. This storage will be volatile and is erased when the instance is restarted, redeployed, or shut down. **Additionally, you get the option to choose Persistent Storage.**

7.  Next, go to the configuration. In the ‘**Template Configuration’** section, replace **'Node Namw'** with your new node name.

8\. Wait for your node to be fully set up. After it's provisioned, you'll see an option called **‘Overview’** in the dashboard; click on it to see all the details of the deployed node on BEVM.

Go to [https://telemetry-testnet.bevm.io/](https://telemetry-testnet.bevm.io/) and look for your node name. It indicates that your node is running as expected. At this point, you don't need to do anything further—just let it run and wait for any official updates from BEVM.
