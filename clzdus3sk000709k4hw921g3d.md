    * üé¨ Provide example use cases or a demo.
        

### Make Sure to fulfill these requirements

1. **Clear Identification:** Make sure it's easy to see what changes or new code you've introduced.
    
2. **Stable URL:** Use a stable URL that won't change after submission.
    
3. **Easy Access:** Ensure that anyone visiting the URL can easily understand your work without needing to look through additional resources.
    
4. **Extendability:** Others should be able to build on your work, whether it's complete or still in progress.
    
5. **Completion Status:** If your work is 100% complete, anyone should be able to use it. If your work is not 100% complete, it should be clear what's left to do.
    

We'll review your submission based on the information provided in your issue and the linked project repository.

## **Evaluation Criteria**

We'll be looking at:

* üèÜ Code quality and documentation (make it sparkle!)
    
* ‚úÖ Functionality and adherence to bounty requirements
    
* üé® User experience and interface design (where applicable)
    
* üí° Innovation and creativity (blow our minds!)
    

Ready to change the future of decentralized GPU accessibility? The Spheron Bounty Program is your chance to shine! We encourage developers from all backgrounds to join us in this exciting venture. Let's make some magic happen! üåü

## üëç Good Example

You don't have to do all (or any) of these things, but you can satisfy the requirements in some ways.

* Create a blog post, web page, or public GitHub gist that showcases the work you've completed, including links to the commits, repositories, and pull requests you've contributed to. This approach is ideal for sharing comprehensive details about your work, making it easy for others to review and understand your contributions.
    
* If you use GitHub and all of your work is contained within a single pull request, link directly to that PR. Ensure that the pull request description is thorough and highlights the specific tasks completed during the project.
    

For a GitHub repository created, consider adding a detailed README.md file. This will provide additional context and clarity for anyone reviewing your work.

## üëé Bad Example

Here are more examples of things you shouldn't do:

* Don't upload a big zip file with all your project files or source code. It's overwhelming and doesn't help people understand your work.
    
* Don't just link to the project's source code repository's main page. For example, linking to the top page of Python's GitHub repository isn't helpful.
    
* Avoid linking to your copy of the project's source code. This will mix your changes with others and make it hard to see what you've done.
    
* A link to a huge log of all the project‚Äôs commits would be ideal, but this would flood the reader with too much information and not highlight your specific contributions.
    
* Share a screenshot of your code instead of the actual code. This makes it impossible for others to review or use your work effectively.
    
* Link to a personal blog mentioning you worked on the project without real details. This doesn‚Äôt provide any useful information about your contributions.
    
* Upload your code as a PDF file. This makes reviewing, editing, or understanding hard, especially for larger projects.
    
* Share a link to a random page in the project‚Äôs documentation. This doesn‚Äôt show your specific work and just confuses people.
    
* Link to a massive text file with no formatting or context. This is overwhelming and makes it difficult to find your relevant contributions.
    

## &lt;/&gt; Code Quality

1. Code Style
    

> Adhere to a consistent code style throughout the project. Consider using linters to enforce these standards automatically.

2. Testing
    

> Write and maintain tests for your code to ensure functionality and to prevent regressions. Prioritize both unit and integration tests.

3. Meaningful Logs
    

> Implement logging throughout your application to help with debugging and monitoring in project. Ensure logs are meaningful and do not expose sensitive information.

4. API Design & Security
    

> If your project involves APIs, follow best practices in API design. Ensure your API is secure, well-documented, and follows consistent naming conventions.

5. Documentation
    

> Provide clear documentation for any APIs your project includes, covering all endpoints, expected inputs, and outputs.

6. User Accessibility
    

> Design your project with accessibility in mind. Ensure it is usable by as wide an audience as possible.

By following these guidelines, you'll ensure your project is not only functional but also maintainable, accessible, and easy for others to contribute to. Happy coding! üöÄ
