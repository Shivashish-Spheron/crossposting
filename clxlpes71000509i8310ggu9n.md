As the advantages and potential of learning language models (LLMs) become more evident, an increasing number of organizations are seeking ways to integrate them into their business processes. LLM chaining frameworks offer a practical and cost-efficient approach for companies to test the capabilities of language models and discover how to best utilize generative AI to achieve their long-term goals.

This guide delves into the concept of LLM chaining, examines various LLM chaining frameworks, and provides insights on choosing the right framework to meet your company’s specific needs.

## Understanding LLM Chaining

LLM chaining refers to the process of connecting large language models to other applications, tools, and services to generate the most effective output from a given input. By linking an LLM to additional components, you can create feature-rich generative AI applications, known as LLM chains, tailored to your specific use case.

A common example of LLM chaining is connecting a pre-trained language model to an external data source to enhance its responses, known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this setup, the user’s prompt is used to query a data source, such as a vector database, for relevant information. This information is then retrieved and used to augment the model’s response, improving its accuracy and relevance.

An LLM chaining framework is a collection of components, libraries, and tools that enable developers to create LLM chains. By providing all the necessary elements to build highly functional LLM applications, development teams can save significant time and resources when developing AI-powered solutions.

## Applications of LLM Chaining Frameworks

LLM chaining frameworks can be used to create a variety of generative applications, including:

* **Chatbot Assistants:** These frameworks provide components to build advanced chatbots. This includes connecting to a data store for accessing domain-specific or proprietary information and incorporating short or long-term memory for recalling previous conversations.
    
* **Document Analysis:** An LLM chain can significantly increase the maximum size of documents that a model can analyze. By connecting a model to tools such as text splitters and chunkers, LLM applications can process larger documents than a foundation model can by default.
    
* **Text Summarizers:** An LLM chain that connects to external information sources enables applications to accurately summarize texts from specialized knowledge domains.
    
* **Semantic Search:** LLM chaining frameworks offer the data retrieval, indexing, and storage mechanisms needed to build high-performing search applications.
    
* **Question Answering (QA) Applications:** These frameworks provide integrations with various data types and sources, making them ideal for developing LLM-powered QA applications.
