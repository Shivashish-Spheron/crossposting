## **1\. Meeting in Dubai and the Spark Behind the Discussion**

**Prakarsh:** Ethan, it’s great to have you here! I remember the first time we met in Dubai. I was immediately intrigued by your work with Particle Network, especially how you’re tackling consumer-facing app challenges in the crypto space.

**Ethan:** Yeah, that was an unforgettable event! Particle Network has been laser-focused on improving user experiences in Web3 by providing authentication and onboarding solutions that feel familiar to the everyday user. We realized that while many are building infrastructure, there’s a real need for solutions that make Web3 apps as easy to use as their Web2 counterparts.

## **2\. The Role of AI, GPUs, and the Evolution of Tech**

**Prakarsh:** Let’s talk about the theme of this episode, "AI, GPUs, and Beyond." Why do you think this focus is so crucial right now?

**Ethan:** AI is a hot topic, but it all started with GPUs. GPUs are the backbone that powers AI advancements, and the applications built on top of this technology are changing the landscape. We’re seeing a similar shift happening in web3, where apps are evolving to become more accessible to the average user, just like what happened with AI.

## **3\. Breaking Down Web3 Barriers: Social Logins and Smart Accounts**

**Prakarsh:** It’s fascinating how Particle Network is pushing the boundaries. Can you tell us more about your work, mainly your focus on social logins and account abstraction?

**Ethan:** Absolutely! We started with social logins to make onboarding seamless. Imagine accessing a dApp without the need to manage complex seed phrases or download additional software—just log in with Google, Twitter, or your email, and you’re good to go. From there, we evolved into smart accounts, leveraging account abstraction to offer features like gasless transactions and social recovery. It’s about making the web3 experience as frictionless as possible.

## **4\. Chain Abstraction: The Next Big Thing in Web3**

**Prakarsh:** You mentioned chain abstraction earlier. Can you elaborate on what that means for the ecosystem?

**Ethan:** Sure! Chain abstraction allows users to interact with multiple blockchains seamlessly without worrying about bridges or network complexities. Imagine having a single account balance that works across different chains—no more jumping through hoops to move your assets. It’s a game-changer that simplifies the entire user journey across the web3 ecosystem.

## **5\. Challenges and Innovations in Multichain UX**

**Prakarsh:** It’s clear that user experience is at the heart of what you’re doing. What are some key challenges you see in creating a multichain UX?

**Ethan:** One of the biggest hurdles is fragmentation. Users often find it challenging to navigate between different applications and blockchains. With chain abstraction, we aim to create a unified user experience that feels natural, regardless of the underlying technology. It’s about removing the barriers and making the web3 space as accessible as the traditional web.

## **6\. The Importance of Developer Experience (DX) in Building the Future**

**Prakarsh:** Speaking of experiences, how do you see the role of developer experience in driving innovation?

**Ethan:** Developer experience is crucial. If developers find it easy to build on a platform, they’re more likely to create amazing apps that attract users. This is why our focus isn’t just on user experience; it's also about making it easier for developers to work with our tech stack. Good DX leads to great UX, and ultimately, that’s what will drive adoption.

## **7\. The Power of Partnerships: Scaling Through Collaboration**

**Prakarsh:** Particle Network has over 900 partnerships across 60 ecosystems—that’s impressive! How do these collaborations impact your mission?

**Ethan:** Partnerships are everything. By integrating with multiple dApps and blockchains, we expand our reach and improve the overall user experience. Our goal is to support these ecosystems, helping them become consumer-ready and driving the next wave of adoption.

## **8\. The Battle Between BD and DevRel on Twitter**

**Prakarsh:** I noticed the ongoing Twitter debate about Business Development (BD) versus Developer Relations (DevRel). Any thoughts on that?

**Ethan:** It’s an interesting debate! Honestly, there’s a lot of overlap between BD and DevRel. Both roles aim to build relationships and drive growth, though from slightly different angles. What’s most important is understanding the value each brings to the table and working together to support the larger mission.

## **9\. The Vision for the Next Decade: Where is Particle Heading?**

**Prakarsh:** Looking ahead, where do you see Particle Network in the next 10 years?

**Ethan:** I see Particle evolving into an invisible force that powers the web3 experience. Our goal is to be the silent infrastructure that enhances user interactions without them even knowing it. It’s like how AWS powers so much of the internet today without being front and center. We want to enable the seamless, universal use of applications across all ecosystems.

## **10\. Becoming Forgettable: The Best Design Philosophy**

**Prakarsh:** That’s such a great philosophy—becoming forgettable. The best designs are the ones you don’t notice because they just work.

**Ethan:** Exactly! The ultimate success is when users don’t have to think about the underlying tech; they just enjoy the benefits. We’re striving to build that kind of infrastructure—reliable, robust, and invisible.

## **11\. The ChatGPT Moment for Web3**

**Prakarsh:** Do you think web3 will have its “ChatGPT moment,” where everything just clicks for the general public?

**Ethan:** I believe it’s coming. AI had years of incremental progress before ChatGPT brought it into the mainstream. Web3 is on a similar path. We’re building the foundational infrastructure now, and soon, a breakthrough application could flip the switch and make it all clear for everyone.

## **12\. Current Roadmap: What’s Next for Particle Network?**

**Prakarsh:** What’s next on the horizon for Particle Network?

**Ethan:** We’re focused on enhancing our chain abstraction solutions and expanding our tech stack. Our aim is to make cross-chain interactions as smooth as possible and continue supporting our partners in building next-gen applications. We’re also exploring new ways to improve our developer tools, ensuring that building on Particle is both intuitive and powerful.

## **13\. The Future of Web3 Infrastructure: Invisible but Indispensable**

**Prakarsh:** It sounds like we’re heading toward a future where web3 infrastructure is invisible yet indispensable. Do you think that’s the right approach?

**Ethan:** Absolutely. The most successful tech blends into the background while enabling extraordinary experiences. We want Particle to be that unnoticeable yet vital layer that empowers developers and delights users.

## **14\. Final Thoughts and Looking Forward to Token 2049 Singapore**

**Prakarsh:** Ethan, it’s been a pleasure having you on Tech Fusion. I’m looking forward to catching up at Token 2049 in Singapore!

**Ethan:** Likewise! It’s going to be a long trip from Denver, but I’m excited to be there. Let’s definitely meet up and continue this conversation.

## **Conclusion**

Today’s episode highlighted the importance of user and developer experiences in shaping the future of tech. Particle Network is at the forefront of this transformation, pushing boundaries with innovative solutions like social logins, smart accounts, and chain abstraction. As we look ahead, the focus remains on creating seamless, invisible infrastructure that powers the next generation of applications—just as AI and GPUs have revolutionized our world today.
