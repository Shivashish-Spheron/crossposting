As we transition into the era of Web3 and the emergence of decentralized applications (DApps), the decentralization of the frontend is gaining significance. The frontend, which constitutes the user-facing component of a DApp, is commonly hosted on centralized servers. However, this centralized setup poses various concerns such as security risks, potential service disruptions, and limited authority over data and user interaction.

Over the past couple of years, the frontend of different organizations whether its government or private has encountered a series of disruptive incidents that have underscored the vulnerabilities within its infrastructure.

## Here are some notable frontend attacks that occurred in 2023

1. **Balancer Frontend Attack:** A [frontend attack](https://blockonomi.com/frontend-attack-targets-defi-platform-balancer-over-240000-hacked/) exploited a vulnerability in the platform’s frontend code, which allowed the attacker to inject malicious code into the protocol’s domain. This contract was then able to steal users’ funds when they interacted with the platform.

The Russian hacking gang, NoName, was responsible for the attacks.
    

## How to achieve decentralized frontend hosting?

Decentralized hosting involves hosting online content without relying on centralized servers or infrastructure, which is typical in traditional web hosting. Instead of storing data on servers owned by a few companies, decentralized hosting uses a network of distributed computers, or nodes, working together to serve content.

**One prevalent method for decentralized web hosting utilizes blockchain technology. This technology provides a secure and transparent way to store and share data. Content is stored on a peer-to-peer network, where each user serves as a node contributing computing power and storage to the network.**

The significance of decentralized hosting lies in its transformation of how websites and online applications are hosted and utilized within the web3 environment. It ensures heightened security, redundancy, and resistance to censorship. Decentralized hosting achieves this by utilizing peer-to-peer networks, blockchain tech, and other distribution methods, ensuring that website files remain accessible even during network disruptions. Since there isn't a single point of failure, the risk of server failures or data loss due to cyberattacks is significantly reduced.

To host a decentralized frontend, you need to use Web3 technologies and tools to create and distribute website files via a network of nodes. Here are the steps to follow:

### 1\. Store the Files on the decentralized network

You can store your frontend files on a web3 system like IPFS. However, it is essential to break these files into smaller segments and distribute them across different nodes within the decentralized network.

**To store files on the network during decentralized web hosting, you can leverage the benefit of Spheron Network. Using the platform, you can use many popular frameworks, like Gatsby, Hugo, Next.js, React, Vue, Vanilla JS, etc. Spheron Network has** [**specific guides**](https://docs.spheron.network/framework-guide/) **for each framework to help you prepare your site. Also, you can follow these blogs for a step-by-step guide.**

3. [Deploy Your Next.js Application on Spheron Network: With and Without APIs](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-your-nextjs-application-on-spheron-network-with-and-without-apis)
    

### 2.Acquire a Domain Name

A domain name is crucial for making your decentralized frontend discoverable. Traditionally, domain names are owned by centralized organizations, but you can obtain a decentralized domain from providers that offer greater control. A decentralized frontend is hosted on a server that a single organization or individual does not manage, and its domain name is also decentralized. As a result, the website's address cannot be revoked, and the data stored on it is secure from tampering or destruction. A platform like [ENS](https://ens.domains/) is an excellent starting point for this.

You must link your website files to the Ethereum Name System (DNS). The time it takes for ENS changes to propagate may vary depending on your service provider. Once the connection is established, you'll obtain a unique hash or identifier for your link.

Follow this blog for a [Guide to Connect Your Static Site with an ENS Domain](https://blog.spheron.network/guide-to-connect-your-static-site-with-ens-domain).

### 3.Set Up Gateways

Dedicated Gateways are IPFS gateways specifically designed to enhance access to pinned content across the network by offering faster speeds and increased rate limits. They ensure a more reliable and consistent experience when accessing and serving content on the IPFS network.

## Simplifying Frontend with Spheron Network

You can establish decentralized hosting for your frontend by distributing it across multiple nodes, elevating availability, security, and decentralization. Web3 infrastructure service providers, like Spheron Network, offer robust solutions for this purpose.

### 2.Spheron Storage

Spheron's Storage provides SDKs as a tool that makes it easy for developers to upload files directly from a web browser to services like IPFS, Filecoin, or Arweave. It handles all the complexities of interacting with the IPFS network so users can focus on building their applications without worrying about the details. The SDK also offers features like encryption, access control, and streaming, making it a powerful tool for creating modern web applications.

**Spheron also provides an intuitive Spheron Browser SDK that allows developers to store their data on IPFS securely. The SDK provides convenient functionalities and supports multiple protocols, allowing developers to use various decentralized storage networks seamlessly. Using the Spheron Browser SDK combined with IPFS provides a powerful and efficient solution for decentralized data storage.**

One of the main advantages of using these SDKs is that you can avoid writing complex code for file uploading, such as multi-chunking and parallelization. Another advantage is that it takes care of storage scalability and redundancy, so users don't have to worry about managing lots of server space or developing a complicated mechanism for load balancing on their server instances.

### 3.Spheron Compute

Spheron simplifies setting up an IPFS node using Spheron Compute and white-labeling the gateway using a custom domain. Spheron Compute allows users to quickly deploy an IPFS node and access its features like IPFS Web Interface and IPFS Gateway. To get started, users can create a new cluster by clicking on the "New Cluster" button and selecting the IPFS template from the marketplace. Spheron Compute also allows users to deploy their IPFS nodes, giving them more ownership over their content. They can add their custom domains and fully control how their content is served.
