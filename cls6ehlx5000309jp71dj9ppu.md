Multichain systems are a newer generation of blockchain technology that offers improved scalability, interoperability, and customizability compared to traditional single-chain systems. They allow for the creation of multiple blockchains that can operate simultaneously, each with its own unique features and capabilities.

This enables businesses to tailor their blockchain applications to suit their needs, increasing efficiency and productivity. This article will delve into the benefits of multichain systems, exploring how they can help businesses overcome the limitations of traditional blockchain platforms.

## Why Businesses Are Cautious About Embracing Blockchain Technology

Businesses often hesitate to embrace blockchain despite its potential for decentralized markets, quick cross-border payments, and real-world asset tokenization. A recent statement from [SEC head Gary Gensler captures](https://milkroad.com/news/bitcoin-is-a-highly-speculative-volatile-asset-says-secs-gensler/#:~:text=Gensler%20Says%20Bitcoin,store%20of%20value.) the prevailing view that Bitcoin is primarily a speculative and volatile asset associated with illicit activities. This perception, common among average US adults, contributes to business apprehension.

Security concerns further amplify the hesitation. Monthly reports of hacked [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://blog.spheron.network/decentralization-regranting-control-power-distribution-of-the-internet) smart contracts raise alarms, as such incidents can result in direct customer fund losses. Security audits, while costly, do not guarantee foolproof protection, making the risk of malicious actors compromising user bases a genuine threat. This poses challenges to customer retention and brand reputation.

**Also, the complexity of blockchain terminology, including terms like 'gas fees,' 'transaction signing,' 'wei,' and 'blocks,' creates frustration for users seeking to invest or engage in a brand's marketplace. This lack of understanding leads to potential social engineering attacks and hinders user participation in blockchain-based activities.**

## Multichain Systems: A New Frontier in Blockchain Security

Securing blockchain applications poses a dual challenge, encompassing both user-facing issues and concerns regarding the trustworthiness of underlying blockchains due to potential hacking risks. Also, businesses grapple with uncertainties related to auditors' evaluations of smart contracts, given the inherent risk involved.

Enterprises may find a solution through multichain systems like Avalanche, allowing them to establish blockchains with customized rules, permissions, and user roles. This capability empowers companies to shape their own regulations. For instance, they can limit transaction participants and specify allowable actions within the network to thwart smart contract attacks.

Precompiles that enforce permissions and roles add an extra layer of security, preventing users from executing specific transactions, such as contract deployment or transfers, according to the business's preferences. This approach enhances security measures for enterprises operating within the blockchain ecosystem.

Multichain systems also facilitate network interoperability, enabling users to avoid asset confinement within application-specific blockchains. Companies gain the flexibility to create bridges connecting their networks with others, enhancing overall security in the operational landscape.

## Are Blockchains Scalable?

**The scalability of blockchains is a feasible prospect. Recent advancements like** [**ZK-rollups**](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups) **enable L2 blockchains to bundle transactions off-chain and present them to the underlying L1 blockchain in a compressed form. The L1 blockchain then verifies their validity using** [**zero-knowledge proofs**](https://blog.spheron.network/how-zero-knowledge-proofs-are-changing-the-future-of-privacy-and-security)**, significantly boosting throughput while maintaining the security provided by the layer-1 networks.**

Yet, scalability is not limited to this method alone. Multichain systems empower us to adjust the time it takes for a block of transactions to be included in the chain, enhancing throughput and facilitating nearly instant operations. Development teams can tailor transaction speed parameters according to their specific needs.

Furthermore, Avalanche introduces a distinctive consensus mechanism, employing sub-sampled voting to validate transactions. This approach ensures minimal transaction latency, surpassing the capabilities of most L1 and L2 blockchains.

## Multichain Systems Benefits

1. **Enhanced Scalability:** Multichain systems allow for workload distribution across multiple interconnected chains, enabling more efficient processing of a higher volume of transactions. This scalability enhancement can pave the way for blockchain applications to handle large-scale adoption and real-world use cases.
    
2. **Improved Interoperability:** Multichain technology facilitates seamless communication and data sharing among blockchains, regardless of their specific features and capabilities. For instance, the [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) platform is a notable example of a multichain network that connects different blockchains, enabling them to interact and transact effectively. This interoperability fosters collaboration, synergy, and innovation across various sectors, promising a more interconnected and efficient ecosystem.
    
3. **Customizable Blockchain Applications:** One of the remarkable advantages of multichain technology is its ability to create optimized blockchain applications tailored to specific needs. Developers can design blockchain networks with features and capabilities optimized for their intended use cases. Furthermore, multi-chain technology enables the creation of interoperable decentralized applications (dApps) that can function seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks. This means that users can access different dApps without switching between various blockchains, significantly improving the user experience.
    
4. **Control Over Permissions:** MultiChain uses cryptographic properties to restrict blockchain access to a list of permitted users, ensuring that the blockchain's activity is only visible to chosen participants and introducing controls over which transactions are permitted.
    
5. **Security:** Each private key has a mathematically related public address representing an identity for receiving funds. Once sent to a public address, those funds can only be spent using the corresponding private key to "sign" a new transaction. In this sense, access to a private key is equivalent to ownership of any funds it protects.
    
6. **Cross-chain Technology:** Cross-chain technology can realize the connection between different blockchains and realize the functions of information interaction and value transfer to form a chain network and achieve the purpose of interconnection. Through cross-chain technology, transactions can be transferred, thus enhancing data processing efficiency.
