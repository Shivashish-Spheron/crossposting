[KIP Protocol](https://www.kip.pro/) is an open-source Web3 framework designed to create, manage, and monetize decentralized Knowledge Assets for AI applications, launching the era of KnowledgeFi. It empowers AI value-creators—whether in data production, model training, app design, or other areas—to connect their expertise, ensuring transparent accounting and revenue sharing. Each component is encapsulated in an ERC-3525 Semi-Fungible Token (SFT), enabling seamless, low-gas transfers of economic value between components in real-time.

## **Why is there a Need for the KIP Protocol?**

The rapidly evolving AI landscape is increasingly dominated by tech giants, posing significant societal challenges due to AI's complexity, opacity, and profound impact on all aspects of human activity.

This monopolistic control over AI is particularly dangerous, with more extensive and profound consequences than monopolies in other tech sectors. We cannot remain passive; the risks to humanity are too significant.

Monopolistic control over AI starts with the absorption of our knowledge and data to train ever-larger models. This is followed by other areas of AI value creation, such as app and agent development, orchestration, and embedding standards, being forced to conform to the closed standards of big tech companies.

KIP Protocol was designed to break this stranglehold through an open Web3 framework that ensures even smaller AI value creators are fairly compensated for their contributions.

KIP Achieve this by creating technical frameworks for connecting AI components, recording interactions on-chain, and efficiently and seamlessly splitting and sharing value.

## KIP Protocol Layers

KIP Protocol consists of three layers:

1. **Application Layer:** AI applications can be deployed on KIP Protocol by minting an ERC-3525 SFT, which connects to AI models and Knowledge Assets. Interactions are recorded on the $KIP ledger.
    
2. **Settlement Layer (Accounting Layer):** Connected applications, models, and Knowledge Assets transfer value efficiently in $KIP. [Technical details are provided here.](https://kipprotocol.gitbook.io/wp/ii-kip-ecosystem/settlement-layer)
    
3. **Ownership Layer:** Data and Knowledge can be stored and encrypted on-chain, accessible to selected AI models for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or training while remaining inaccessible to humans to prevent piracy.
    

Anyone can use the KIP Protocol to create, protect, and secure their Knowledge Assets on-chain.

## KIP Protocol Function

Below is an overview of KIP Protocol functions:

| **Knowledge Asset creation** | Minting of ERC-3525 SFTs. |
| --- | --- |
| **Knowledge Asset trading (including fractionalised trading)** | Order placement and payment and asset transfer. Fractionalising of Knowledge Asset SFTs for greater liquidity and portfolio construction by Knowledge Investors. |
| **Network verification** | Nodes check API uptime and report back to the KIP DAO regarding broken links or malicious providers. |
| **Automated revenue share** | Automated split and sharing of revenues among app, model and dataset owners. |
| **Knowledge Asset crowdfunding** | App, model and dataset owners can demonstrate past revenue and seek funds for further expansion by selling a portion of their future revenues to investors. |
| **Token Gating** | Creator use of KIP Protocol SFTs to token-gate access to their own works. |
| **Decentralised RAG** | Using KIP Protocol to carry out decentralised RAG, incorporating contributions from app developers, model trainers and data owners, ensuring fair payments to each. |
| **Decentralised RLHF** (experimental) | Using KIP Protocol to organise & incentivise human reinforcement learning in AI model training. |
| **Decentralised recording nodes** (experimental) | Use of websocket access nodes and eventually possibly an independent app chain with its own RPC nodes and validators for the purpose of storing data. |

## $KIP Token

**$KIP Token** The $KIP token serves as the fuel of the KIP Protocol and powers the entire ecosystem of the KIP Protocol.

The $KIP token serves multiple crucial functions within the KIP Protocol ecosystem:

1. **Ownership Representation:** $KIP tokens represent ownership of knowledge assets through ERC-3525 Semi-Fungible Tokens (SFTs), granting control to creators and token holders.
    
2. **Transaction Currency:** $KIP tokens are used for transactions within the ecosystem, facilitating the monetization of data assets and providing a transparent record of dataset and model usage.
    
3. **Grants and Rewards:** Through the KIP DAO, $KIP tokens fund innovative research projects and incentivize community engagement, encouraging the development and review of valuable knowledge bases.
    
4. **DAO Governance:** $KIP token holders participate in decentralized decision-making, voting on protocol upgrades, grants, and crucial decisions, shaping the protocol's future.
    
5. **KIP Starter Launchpad:** $KIP tokens can be staked for project allocations and funding, aligning projects with community interests and supporting growth potential.
    
6. **KIP X Exchange:** $KIP tokens facilitate the trading of fractionalized knowledge assets on KIP X, offering investment opportunities and trading fee rebates for participants.
    
7. **Community Building:** $KIP tokens reward community builders and fund community-driven projects, educational initiatives, and events, fostering a vibrant ecosystem.
