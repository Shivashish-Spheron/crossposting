When it comes to setting up a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database for your web application or project, the last thing you want is to spend hours configuring and fine-tuning the database. Fortunately, deploying a MySQL database can be a quick and painless process if you use the right tools. In this blog post, we'll walk you through the steps to deploy a MySQL database within minutes using Spheron Compute. Spheron Compute offers an effortless and straightforward way to get your database up and running on the Akash Network. So, let's get started!

## **What is Spheron Network?**

[Spheron Network](https://spheron.network/) is a next-generation PaaS that offers low-cost and seamless access to Web3 infrastructure across multiple chains. It is explicitly designed to serve a broader audience, including startups, developers, and organizations looking to scale their infrastructure.

Spheron Network offers a Compute Marketplace that you can use to quickly set up useful tools like MySQL. With Spheron, you don't have to worry about the technical stuff and you can focus on deploying a MySQL database with ease. In addition to compute, web hosting, and storage capabilities, Spheron offers many features to enhance productivity and enable stakeholders to reach new heights while prioritizing privacy, security, and reliability.

## **How to deploy a MySQL database using Spheron Compute?**

You can follow these steps to deploy a MySQL database on Spheron Compute.

### **Step 1: Create a Free Spheron Network Account**

1. Visit Spheron Network: [https://spheron.network/](https://docs.spheron.network/)
    
2. On the Spheron homepage, locate and click the "Free Trial" button.
    
3. You'll be directed to a login/signup page. Choose your preferred authentication method: Web2 (GitHub account, GitLab account, or Bitbucket account) or Web3 (Ethereum).
    
4. Follow the provided prompts to authenticate your chosen account securely. This step ensures safe access to the Spheron Network platform.
    
5. After successful authentication, you'll be guided to a confirmation page confirming the completion of your account setup.
    

### **Step 2: Creating an Organization**

1. Upon logging in, navigate to the "Compute" section using the dropdown on the top right corner.
    
2. You'll be prompted to create your organization's name, username, and Avatar. Add and click “Save”.
    
3. Next, you'll be taken to a new page. Click the "New Cluster" button.
    

### **Step 3: Deploying a MySQL database With Spheron Platform UI**

Follow these steps to deploy a MySQL database:

1. Choose "Compute" to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
    
2. Choose the type of compute you need from the options under "Compute Type." You can pick the one that suits your requirements.
    

**NOTE:** Please schedule a team call to gain early access to On Demand Type.

1. Select "Start from Marketplace App".
    
2. Pick "MySQL" from the marketplace. It's as easy as choosing an app you want to install.
    
3. Select your preferred region for deployment. The container will be deployed in any region for Spot, or in the EU-east region for On Demand. Choosing a region closer to your users can improve performance and reduce latency. Spheron offers the following regions to choose from for Spot:
    
    * US-east
        
    * US-west
        
    * US-central
        
    * EU-west
        
    * Any
        

**NOTE:** It is recommended to select any region for Spot to get a higher chance of successful deployment as it will deploy on any providers in the network.

1. Next, Choose an instance plan that aligns with your requirements. Spheron will recommend a suitable plan according to the IPFS template, but you can customize it if needed from available plans or choose to **'Create Custom Plans.'**
    
2. Next, Configure storage:  
    You have to choose Storage from the available options. This storage will be volatile storage and is erased when the instance is restarted, redeployed, or shut down.
    
    Additionally, you get the option to choose Persistent Storage. Persistent storage will not be erased unless the instance is closed. If choosing persistent storage, specify the type of storage (HDD, SSD, NVMe) and Add mount point.
    
3. For advanced configurations, feel free to explore more options. Just [click here](https://docs.spheron.network/compute/cluster/#advance-configuration-1) to learn more about these advanced settings.
    
4. Once you're all set, click "Deploy" to start the deployment process. It's as simple as that!
    

That's it! Your MySQL database instance will now be deployed.

**NOTE:** Keep in mind that you can access the MySQL database only after the Compute Instance is provisioned. So, allow some time for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

## **Connecting to MySQL database**

* You can run the following command in your terminal to connect to your MySQL server:
    
    ```javascript
    mysql -h [host] -P [port] -u root -p
    ```
