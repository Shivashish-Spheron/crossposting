Congratulations! üéâ You‚Äôve successfully installed **Fizz Node** on your Windows machine using **WSL**. Now, you can run Linux applications in your Windows environment without the need for a separate Linux machine or virtual machine.

If you encounter any problems, feel free to revisit this guide or consult the official documentation for [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).

# Earnings and Rewards

Fizz Nodes earn rewards based on two factors: resource contribution and uptime.

* **Resource Contribution**: You‚Äôll earn more if your node provides higher-tier resources such as a powerful GPU or more CPU cores.
    
* **Uptime**: Fizz Nodes must maintain at least 50% uptime within an ERA (24 hours) to receive rewards.
    

The final reward calculation is a combination of the resource performance and uptime factor. This system encourages node operators to maintain stable, reliable operations while rewarding those who contribute higher-quality resources to the network.

On top of that, Fizz Node operators also earn direct payments from users who lease their compute resources. Operators keep 90% of the payment, with a small fee going to the network and providers. You can withdraw these earnings at any time from your dashboard.

## Fizz Node Benefits

Beyond providing decentralized compute resources, running a Fizz Node offers several exclusive perks:

* **Monetize your idle compute power** by selling resources in an open market.
    
* Earn **$FN points** that will eventually merge with **$SPHN** tokens.
    
* Join the first **DePIN Super Compute Network**, designed to distribute energy usage and help reduce carbon emissions.
    
* Become eligible for the **Fizzer Special Discord Role**, unlocking special rewards like **$500 monthly quests**‚Äîon top of regular rewards from resource contributions.
    
* **Early Access to Updates & Announcements** ‚Äì Be the first to learn about Spheron Network's upcoming features so you can prepare and take full advantage.
    
* **And More to Come** ‚Äì As we approach our token launch, there are plenty of additional perks in the pipeline!
    

# Fizz Nodes: The Easiest Way to Join the DePIN & AI Revolution

At the end of the day, Fizz Nodes represent a new model for decentralized compute‚Äîone that‚Äôs accessible, profitable, and easy to manage. They‚Äôre a critical piece in Spheron‚Äôs broader decentralized vision that lets anyone with a modest setup participate in a network traditionally reserved for institutional players.

So if you‚Äôve ever wanted to dip your toes into decentralized compute without needing to break the bank on hardware, now‚Äôs your chance. Get your node up and running, and start contributing to the future of decentralized compute today!

## **Troubleshooting Tips**

Encountering issues during the setup process? Here are some common troubleshooting tips.

* **Docker Commands Not Working:**
    
    * Ensure that **Docker Desktop** is running. Look for the Docker icon in the system tray (bottom-right corner of your screen).
        
    * Make sure that WSL integration is enabled in Docker settings for Ubuntu.
        
* **Permission Denied Error:**
    
    * If you see a ‚ÄúPermission Denied‚Äù error, double-check that you made the script executable with the `chmod +x fizzup.sh` command.
        
* **Can't Find the Script:**
    
    * Remember that Windows drives can be accessed through WSL using the `/mnt/` directory. For instance, `C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents` becomes `/mnt/c/Users/YourName/Documents` in WSL.
        
* **Still Having Problems?**
    
    * Try running the Ubuntu terminal as administrator.
        
    * Ensure that all software, including Docker and WSL, is up to date.
