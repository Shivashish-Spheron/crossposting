# **Fizz Node Compatibility & System Requirements**

You don‚Äôt need to be a high-end crypto miner or have access to a top-tier data center to participate in running a Fizz Node. In fact, even if you have a laptop with decent GPU capabilities and a few good CPU threads, you're more than ready to contribute to the decentralized network. Your underutilized resources are all you need to help power the future of decentralized infrastructure!

Fizz Nodes are currently supported on **macOS** and **Linux**, with Windows support arriving soon. Performance may vary based on the operating system in use. Below are the necessary specs for running your own Fizz Node:

### **Minimum Specifications**

* 4 CPUs
    
* 8 GB RAM
    
* 100 GB Disk Space
    

### **Maximum Specifications**

* 32 CPUs
    
* 128 GB RAM
    
* 2000 GB Disk Space
    

> **Note:** To run the Fizz Node in privileged mode, root or sudo access is required. This elevated permission is essential for executing system-level operations necessary for node functionality.

9\. Click **‚ÄúRegister Your Fizz Node‚Äú,** To complete the registration, you'll need some ETH on the Spheron chain for gas fees. If you don't have any, you can get some from our faucet at¬†[faucet.spheron.network](http://faucet.spheron.network).

Once you confirm the transaction, your node will be officially registered in the Spheron network, and you can proceed to the next steps**.**

Boom üí•‚Äî You‚Äôre officially part of the decentralized revolution!

### **Running the Fizz Node Client**

After successfully registering your node, you need to set up and run the Fizz node client on your machine. This client software connects your node to the Spheron network and manages resource allocation. Follow these steps:

1. Access the setup page for your registered node. There, You should find a link to download the [`fizzup.sh`](http://fizzup.sh) script.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727799722587/f8b28be6-923f-4fec-bcdc-12c9d21aef23.png align="center")
    
2. **Download the** [`fizzup.sh`](http://fizzup.sh) script to your machine. Save it in a location you can easily access via a terminal or command prompt.
    
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script. Make the script executable by running the following command:
    
    ```plaintext
    chmod +x <location of fizzup script>/fizzup.sh
    ```
    
    **Replace** `<location of fizzup script>` with the actual path to the script's directory.
    
4. **Run the script by entering the following command:**
    
    ```plaintext
    <location of fizzup script>/fizzup.sh
    ```
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727799971654/11221434-7be0-4619-9dfc-23bc7d183ea1.png align="center")
    
5. This command executes the script and starts the Fizz node client on your machine.
    
6. To verify if your Fizz node is running, use the following command:
    
    ```plaintext
    docker-compose -f ~/.spheron/fizz/docker-compose.yml logs -f
    ```
    
    If this doesn't work, try:
    
    ```plaintext
    docker compose -f ~/.spheron/fizz/docker-compose.yml logs -f
    ```
    
    These commands will show you the logs of your Fizz node, allowing you to confirm it's running correctly.

Once you've verified the node is running, return to the setup page on the Spheron Fizz App.

1. On the setup page, you'll see a "Check Status" button and a switch to "Automatically check status." Click the "Check Status" button to manually initiate a status check for your Fizz node.
    
2. Alternatively, you can toggle on the "Automatically check status" switch to have the system periodically check your node's status without manual intervention.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727800455801/f91a3d99-ed67-4dfe-91ec-7f1715016559.png align="center")
    
3. The system will now perform checks to validate if your node is active and correctly configured.
    

The validation process may take a few minutes. During this time, the system verifies your node's connectivity, resource availability, and configuration. Once your node is confirmed active, you will be automatically directed to your Fizz dashboard.

# Earnings and Rewards

Fizz Nodes earn rewards based on two factors: resource contribution and uptime.

* **Resource Contribution**: You‚Äôll earn more if your node provides higher-tier resources such as a powerful GPU or more CPU cores.
    
* **Uptime**: Fizz Nodes must maintain at least 50% uptime within an ERA (24 hours) to receive rewards.
    

The final reward calculation is a combination of the resource performance and uptime factor. This system encourages node operators to maintain stable, reliable operations while rewarding those who contribute higher-quality resources to the network.

On top of that, Fizz Node operators also earn direct payments from users who lease their compute resources. Operators keep 90% of the payment, with a small fee going to the network and providers. You can withdraw these earnings at any time from your dashboard.

## Fizz Node Benefits

Beyond providing decentralized compute resources, running a Fizz Node offers several exclusive perks:

* **Monetize your idle compute power** by selling resources in an open market.
    
* Earn **$FN points** that will eventually merge with **$SPHN** tokens.
    
* Join the first **DePIN Super Compute Network**, designed to distribute energy usage and help reduce carbon emissions.
    
* Become eligible for the **Fizzer Special Discord Role**, unlocking special rewards like **$500 monthly quests**‚Äîon top of regular rewards from resource contributions.
    
* **Early Access to Updates & Announcements** ‚Äì Be the first to learn about Spheron Network's upcoming features so you can prepare and take full advantage.
    
* **And More to Come** ‚Äì As we approach our token launch, there are plenty of additional perks in the pipeline!
    

# Fizz Nodes: The Easiest Way to Join the DePIN & AI Revolution

At the end of the day, Fizz Nodes represent a new model for decentralized compute‚Äîone that‚Äôs accessible, profitable, and easy to manage. They‚Äôre a critical piece in Spheron‚Äôs broader decentralized vision that lets anyone with a modest setup participate in a network traditionally reserved for institutional players.

So if you‚Äôve ever wanted to dip your toes into decentralized compute without needing to break the bank on hardware, now‚Äôs your chance. Get your node up and running, and start contributing to the future of decentralized compute today!
