We won't be able to onboard millions of users into cryptocurrency if we have nothing to offer them. It's easy to discuss the advantages of decentralization, but convincing people to change their habits is a different story. DePIN provides a physical connection to the blockchain, introducing people to the exceptional problem-solving capabilities that cryptocurrency networks can provide. This is made possible by some amazing products that have recently hit the market.

Let's examine some of the signature devices leading the current wave of cryptocurrency adoption.

## 1\. [NATIX](https://www.natix.network/) on your smartphone

Do you know that your smartphone could be the gateway to DePIN? With its advanced sensors such as microphone, camera, gyroscope, temperature, accelerometer, and more, your smartphone can achieve a lot. NATIX is a project that uses a smartphone app to tackle the issue of fresh map data. The app is free to download and use, making it accessible to everyone. **You can download the NATIX app now and use "hotspot" as your referral code to get 35,000 bonus points.**

## 2\. [Wicrypt](https://wicrypt.com/) Spider Wi-Fi Hotspot

Wicrypt is addressing the issue of internet connectivity in Africa by providing a range of long-range WiFi routers. One of their products, the Spider hotspot, can support up to 70 simultaneous connections and cover distances of up to 200m. The hotspot provides users with WiFi internet (up to 300 Mbps) using a SIM card slot and 4G-LTE receiving capabilities.

This is an excellent solution for highly populated areas like markets, cultural centers, and sporting venues, as well as residential areas. Business owners can benefit from investing in this product since it can provide WiFi access to their customers, while also earning them **$WNT tokens for contributing to the growth of the Wicrypt network.**

**This product is perfect for the African market and currently retails for around $270. It can be purchased using USDT and USDC or through their Shopify store for more traditional payment methods.**

By providing reliable, expandable, and affordable internet solutions, Wicrypt is providing a foundation for a thriving African DePIN ecosystem

## 3\. [ATOR Relay](https://www.ator.io/)

ATOR is developing an anonymity layer to route traffic for DePIN projects. The ATOR Relay will function as the entry point to this layer. This is a lightweight model that doesn't require a 19-inch rack for housing. Security is of the utmost importance, and the model comes equipped with an encryption chip and CryptoAuth key generation. It can support 1,000 Mbps Ethernet and also works on WiFi, and it can be easily configured via USB.

**Users who run nodes on the ATOR network will be eligible for $ATOR tokens. However, if you use ATOR's official Relay, you won't need to lock up an additional 100 $ATOR tokens for 180 days, which is an added bonus.**

The first 1,000 units were reserved in a presale last year. During this sale, users could mint an Atornaut NFT for 0.1 ETH. Once these NFTs are ready to ship, owners will be invited to pay 250 $ATOR to redeem their Relay. If you want to get in on the action, there are a few Atornaut NFTs trading on OpenSea.

In addition to the official Relay model, ATOR will allow other DePIN hardware to operate through its network. They've partnered with Hotspotty to assist with this integration.

## 4\. [DIMO Macaron](https://drivedimo.com/products/macaron)

The DIMO Macaron is a device that can be easily plugged into your car's OBD-II (onboard diagnostics) port. This port can be found under the dashboard of most modern cars and is used by mechanics to access important data about your vehicle. The Macaron is compatible with cars dating back to 2008, so you don't need to worry about having a brand-new car to use it.

The Macaron sends data over the Helium IoT network and includes three years of connectivity in its affordable $99 price. It's small enough to be unobtrusive for the driver, and it's powered by the car itself, so there's no need to replace batteries.

## 5\. [Weather XM WS2000](https://weatherxm.com/product/ws2000-helium-lorawan/) Weather Station

Weather is an essential part of our daily lives, and Weather XM has devised a unique solution to increase forecast accuracy by adding more weather data collection points. Unlike traditional centralized stations, Weather XM's various stations allow users to combine their personal station data to create hyper-localized weather reporting.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1712042690203/b436031a-e448-4595-adc2-34defe60ceae.png align="center")

These advanced weather stations are far superior to the old-school mercury meters, and they can monitor a variety of factors, including atmospheric pressure, temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind, and UV. **Installing a Weather XM station is easy, and you can even earn $WXM tokens by owning one. The project offers three stations, each with a different connectivity option and price point. The WS2000, which is pictured above, sends its data over LoRaWAN and is preconfigured for the Helium network. This particular station costs $400.**

If you're interested in purchasing one of these weather stations, head over to the [WeatherXM shop](https://weatherxm.com/product/ws2000-helium-lorawan/) to order your station. Whether it's raining, sunny, or anything in between, you'll never be caught off guard again.

## 6\. [GEODNET](https://hyfix.ai/products/mobilecm-triple-band-gnss-base-station) MobileCM Triple-Band GNSS Base-Station

NET is using a decentralized solution to develop its Real-Time Kinetic (RTK) correction network. Sophisticated antennasimprove positioning accuracy to the centimeter level. The owners of these antennas are also rewarded with GEOD tokens. The DePIN deployers are essentially mining the sky!

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1712042804908/2497ffc8-8a4f-4d75-bb34-6ca3cddb1963.png align="center")

The GEODNET triple band GNSS base station is compatible with the four major constellations: GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, and BeiDou, which makes it satellite agnostic. A clear line of sight to the sky is required to get it working, but this can be achieved in both urban and rural environments.

You can buy a GEODNET mining station for $695. Interestingly, there are reward multipliers available (up to 14x) to encourage map coverage. If you're targeting one of these regions, your ROI could be secured quicker than expected. You can read more about it in our recent GEODNET article.

These units are currently in high demand, and deliveries are expected to ship as soon as possible. We recommend contacting [EasyNav](https://www.easynav.xyz/), which has worldwide distribution rights. **Make sure to use the discount code HOTSPOTTY when contacting them.** Providing precise positioning will be a high-value service in a world of autonomous devices.
