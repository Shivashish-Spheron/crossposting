On September 12, 2024, OpenAI introduced [GPT-01](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), also known as “Strawberry.” This release is the first of a planned series of reasoning models aimed at solving complex tasks more effectively. While previous models, like GPT-4, excelled at generating human-like text and responses, GPT-01 brings something new: advanced reasoning capabilities to tackle multi-step problems, such as complicated math, logic, and coding tasks.

## **What Is Advanced Reasoning in AI?**

Advanced reasoning refers to the AI’s ability to process information logically and step-by-steply, similar to how a human would tackle a problem. While earlier models mainly focused on pattern recognition and data-based predictions, GPT-01 can break down tasks into smaller steps, analyze them, and provide a coherent solution.

This leap in reasoning power makes GPT-01 particularly effective in areas where multi-step logic is essential, such as coding, mathematical proofs, and strategic planning.

GPT-01 represents a significant milestone in AI research, particularly in reasoning. By pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve, this model sets the stage for future innovations in AI development, bringing us closer to creating autonomous systems capable of complex decision-making.

The introduction of advanced reasoning in GPT-01 paves the way for more sophisticated AI applications, particularly in fields that require logical thinking and problem-solving. As models evolve, AI may take on more significant roles in decision-making processes, from healthcare to engineering.

## **Why Is the Model Called “Strawberry”?**

GPT -01 was nicknamed “Strawberry” to reflect its user-friendliness and adaptability. According to OpenAI, the model was designed with human-like interaction in mind, making it a more intuitive and collaborative tool.

## **Key Features of GPT-01 “Strawberry”**

### **1\. Coding: Thoroughly Analyzing Each Instruction**

It’s fascinating how GPT-01 generates code compared to GPT-4. The GPT-01 preview version takes time, carefully considering the prompt. In programming, we often provide detailed instructions, and GPT-4 tends to miss or overlook some aspects, much like how we might feel when juggling too many tasks simultaneously. However, GPT-01 meticulously processes all the information, analyzing every requirement slowly and thoroughly.

In a demonstration, they used the following coding prompt:
