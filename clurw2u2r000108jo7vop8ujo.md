The world is becoming increasingly digitized, mainly due to the need for processing power and computing resources. This trend has been even more pronounced since the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a rise in remote work. Companies and individuals are turning to cloud computing services to comply with social distancing measures, reduce office maintenance, and maintain productivity. However, traditional cloud services have security vulnerabilities and high costs, primarily because of market concentration among major providers like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Alibaba.

Decentralized or peer-to-peer cloud computing models have emerged to address these issues. These solutions use nodal blockchain-based networks to enhance security and reduce censorship. Despite sharing a common ideology, these solutions differ in their approaches. In this article, we will explore the leading decentralized computing initiatives, examining their distinct features, benefits, and how they advance the cause of accessible computing resources in today's digital age.

Greg Osuri founded Akash Network, an open-source, decentralized cloud computing platform. Known as the “Airbnb for cloud computing,” Akash is an open Supercloud network that makes it easy to scale and access services around the world rapidly. It uses a "reverse auction" system, where customers submit their desired price and providers compete for the business. According to Akash, this often results in prices that are up to 85% lower than those of other cloud systems.

Akash is owned and managed by its community. It is a free public service, and the source code that powers it is available to everyone. It is built on dependable technologies like Kubernetes and Cosmos, and the community oversees all aspects of Akash — including decisions about what new features should be implemented.
