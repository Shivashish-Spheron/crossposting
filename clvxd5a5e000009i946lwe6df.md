[Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/agents-artificial-intelligence/) have been widely acknowledged as a cornerstone in achieving human-like AI capabilities and have been at the forefront of extensive research and innovation. These artificial entities are designed to sense their environment, make autonomous decisions, and execute actions accurately. Despite numerous efforts to refine algorithms and enhance training strategies to augment specific abilities and optimize performance in designated tasks, there remains a notable absence of a versatile and robust model that can outperform human intelligence.

A firm foundation is essential for creating AI agents that adapt to any situation. [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://blog.spheron.network/top-15-open-source-llms-for-2024-and-their-uses) are highly versatile and have the potential to facilitate the evolution of [Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence). They are becoming the preferred choice for researchers seeking to develop universally adaptable AI agents. The field has made significant progress using LLMs as the foundational bedrock for AI agent development.

The agent concept has evolved significantly since its philosophical inception and has been intricately developed in AI. It is widely acknowledged that LLMs are the apt foundations for such agents. Our team has introduced a comprehensive framework for LLM-based agents, which incorporates three core components: brain, perception, and action, and is adaptable to various applications. Furthermore, we have explored the extensive applications and implications of LLM-based agents in single-agent scenarios and multi-agent environments and in synergy with human-agent collaborations.

## **What is an AI agent?**

LLM-powered agents are highly advanced systems that can reason through complex problems, create effective plans to solve them and execute them using various tools. These agents possess complex reasoning capabilities, a vast memory, and the ability to execute tasks seamlessly. Their capabilities have been observed in projects such as [AutoGPT](https://autogpt.net/) and [BabyAGI](https://babyagi.org/), where they have successfully solved complex problems with minimal intervention. Here's a general architecture of an LLM-powered agent application (Figure 1).

## Core Components of LLM-Based AI Agents

At the heart of an LLM-based AI agent are three essential elements that work together to enable its functionality:

### **1\. Agent core**

The agent core is the central module that coordinates the overall logic and behavior of an AI agent. It serves as the primary decision-making unit, managing various aspects of the agent's functionality. The core typically consists of the following elements:

![The Agent core has access to Goals, Tools, planning helpers and a general format for the answer. ](https://developer-blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Figure-2-Basic-template-of-how-the-different-modules-of-an-agent-are-assembled-in-its-core.png align="center")

1. **General Goals of the Agent**: This section outlines the overarching objectives and goals that guide the agent's actions and decision-making processes.
    
2. **Tools for Execution**: This is essentially a catalog or "user manual" that lists the various tools and resources available to the agent for performing specific tasks or accessing external services.
    
3. **Explanation of Planning Modules**: This part details the different planning modules available to the agent and their respective utilities. It helps the agent determine which planning module to employ in a given situation.
    
4. **Relevant Memory**: This dynamic section retrieves and presents the most pertinent memory items from previous conversations with the user based on the current query or context. The relevance of memory items is determined using the user's question or input.
    
5. **Agent Persona (Optional)**: This optional component describes the agent's persona, which can influence its behavior, tool preferences, or the idiosyncrasies exhibited in its final responses.
    

### **2\. Memory Module**

This module acts as a repository for the agent's internal logs and records of its interactions with the user. It consists of two types: 

* Short-term memory: A record of the agent's thought processes and actions taken to address a specific question from the user.
    
* Long-term memory: A comprehensive log of the agent's actions, thoughts, and conversation history with the user, spanning an extended period.
    

### 3\. Tools

These are well-defined, executable workflows or specialized APIs that the agent can utilize to perform specific tasks. Examples include retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines for context-aware answer generation, code interpreters for programming tasks, search APIs for querying the internet, and various other APIs for services like weather information or instant messaging.

### 4\. Planning Module

Complex problems often require nuanced approaches, which a combination of task and question decomposition techniques and reflection or critique mechanisms can facilitate. The planning module helps the agent break down complex problems into manageable subtasks and encourages self-evaluation or reflection on the agent's thought processes

## Versatility and Adaptability

Agents based on large language models (LLMs) have gained recognition for their adaptability and competence across an array of situations, such as:

1. Single Agent Settings: These agents perform exceptionally well when tackling individual tasks or processes.
    
2. Multi-agent Interactions: Here, the LLM-based agents collaborate and compete with fellow AI entities, exhibiting sophisticated conduct.
    
3. Human-AI Teaming: In this context, these advanced systems work seamlessly alongside humans to boost efficiency while generating inventive problem-solving approaches.
    

Moreover, by forming elaborate networks replicating human social engagements, these artificial intelligence offer fascinating perspectives on interpersonal dynamics and organizational constructs.

## Types of LLM-Based AI Agents and Their Mathematical Foundations

1. **Reactive Agents:** Operating through predefined rules, these agents react immediately to environmental alterations without any internal memory or capacity for learning. In mathematical terms, their functioning can be expressed via if-then-else statements and Boolean logic.
    
2. **Model-Based Agents:** Featuring an internal environment model, these agents adjust their reactions to shifts in their surroundings and previous encounters. They rely on state transition models and updating mechanisms to facilitate adaptation and learning.
    
3. **Goal-Based Agents:** Driven by explicit objectives, these agents modify their activities dynamically to accomplish desired outcomes. Their modus operandi involves utilizing search algorithms and optimization strategies to discover optimal routes to achieving set targets.
    
4. **Utility-Based Agents:** Leveraging utility functions, such entities aim to enhance total contentment or benefit by strategizing actions that yield maximum returns. Mathematical optimization and decision theories serve as foundational tools enabling informed selections.
    
5. **Learning Agents:** Capable of refining conduct progressively in response to experiential data, these agents continually implement machine learning approaches alongside statistical methodologies and reinforced training tactics to augment operational efficiency.
    

## The Advantages of GPUs in LLM Training

This capability significantly speeds up the computation-intensive tasks required for training LLMs, thus enabling the development of intricate and extensive models. The powerful combination of GPU's computational strength and the sophisticated algorithms of LLMs is opening up fresh opportunities and advancing the limits of AI capabilities.

## Mathematical Logic Underpinning LLMs

The theoretical underpinning of Language Learning Models (LLMs) is complex and multifaceted, encompassing various advanced mathematical concepts and computational methods. Among these critical mathematical elements are:

* Probability theory, which deals with managing uncertainty, forecasting outcomes, and constructing probabilistic relationships;
    
* Linear algebra is foundational for conducting neural network activities, implementing vector transformations, and performing matrix multiplication;
    
* Calculus vital for fine-tuning model parameters using optimization techniques like gradient descent and backpropagation;
    
* Information theory is instrumental in efficiently encoding and decoding data inside the model while quantifying uncertainty and gauging knowledge acquisition.
    

## Future Prospects

Integrating LLMs with GPUs is revolutionizing AI, unlocking limitless possibilities and breakthroughs. With the power of mathematical logic and GPU processing, AI agents are becoming highly intelligent, adaptable, and versatile, ready to reshape industries such as healthcare, finance, education, and more.
