When designing applications powered by large language models (LLMs), it is crucial to decide between using AI agents or a more conventional pipeline approach. While AI agents are flexible, adaptive, and interactive, they're not always the best fit for every problem. On the other hand, pipelines, which pass the output of one task as the input to the next in a predefined sequence, offer a structured and predictable alternative.

In this article, we'll explore the differences between AI agents and AI pipelines and identify which approach is better suited for specific types of applications. We’ll also use the CrewAI framework to demonstrate both techniques by building simple apps with different workflows.

## **What Are AI Agents?**

[AI agents](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ai-agents/) represent autonomous entities that can make decisions and interact with users dynamically. They are often used for more complex, open-ended applications where decision-making is required based on user input. In this setup, the agent may ask multiple questions, adapt responses, and offer solutions or guidance in real time.

For example, consider a virtual assistant designed to help users troubleshoot their computer issues. If someone says, “My laptop won't connect to Wi-Fi,” the AI agent would follow up with questions like:

* Is the Wi-Fi switch turned on?
    
* Are other devices connecting to the same network?
    
* Have you tried restarting your router?
    

Based on the answers, the agent can offer more refined advice or ask additional questions until the problem is resolved.

## **AI Agent Example: Customer Support Chatbot**

Let’s take a customer service scenario. A user is trying to solve a problem with their air conditioner. They interact with an AI chatbot, which operates as an intelligent agent, asking questions about the issue's make, model, and symptoms to troubleshoot it.

Here’s an outline of how an AI agent operates in such a scenario:

* **Task**: Help diagnose air conditioner problems.
    
* **Agent Behavior**: The agent dynamically asks relevant questions, based on previous user responses, to narrow down the issue and suggest solutions.
    

Using the CrewAI framework, let’s create a simple example of a chatbot agent that can assist with air conditioner troubleshooting.

```plaintext
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Define the agent
support_agent = Agent(
    role="Customer Support Agent",
    goal="Help diagnose and fix air conditioner problems",
    backstory="You are a seasoned HVAC technician.",
    tools=[],
    llm="gpt-4"
)

# Define the task
task = Task(
    description="My air conditioner isn’t cooling the room.",
    expected_output="A diagnosis and potential solution to the problem.",
    agent=support_agent
)

# Define the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[support_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True
)

# Execute the crew
result = crew.kickoff()

print(result.raw)
```

In this scenario, the AI agent asks questions like “Is the air filter clean?” or “Is the thermostat set to the correct temperature?” The agent continues interacting with the user until it solves the problem or refers them to a human technician.

## **What Are AI Pipelines?**

In contrast to agents, [AI pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/pipelines/docs) are a sequence of predefined tasks where each task’s output is used as input for the next one. They are especially effective for repetitive and well-defined processes, such as generating reports, performing data transformations, or processing documents.

Pipelines follow a strict order of operations, and each task is focused on a specific, narrow function. For instance, if you need to generate sales reports regularly from a set of spreadsheets, a pipeline can efficiently consolidate the data, generate charts, and create a final report in one linear process.

## **Pipeline Example: Monthly Sales Report Generator**

Let’s say the head of sales for a retail company wants a monthly sales report. The pipeline could include the following steps:

1. **Data Consolidation**: Combine sales data from multiple branches.
    
2. **Analysis**: Generate insights based on sales trends.
    
3. **Chart Generation**: Create bar and line charts comparing branch performance.
    
4. **Report Writing**: Summarize the data and charts into a final report.
    

Here's how a pipeline app could work in CrewAI to generate such a report:

```plaintext
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Define the agent for data consolidation
consolidation_agent = Agent(
    role="Data Analyst",
    goal="Consolidate sales data from various branches",
    backstory="You specialize in data aggregation.",
    llm="gpt-4"
)

# Define the agent for chart generation
chart_agent = Agent(
    role="Chart Creator",
    goal="Generate visual representations of sales data.",
    backstory="You are an expert in creating graphs and charts.",
    llm="gpt-4"
)

# Define the agent for report writing
report_agent = Agent(
    role="Report Writer",
    goal="Summarize sales data and insights into a final report.",
    backstory="You have experience in crafting business reports.",
    llm="gpt-4"
)

# Define the tasks
task1 = Task(
    description="Consolidate sales data from branches for August.",
    expected_output="A single dataset of sales data.",
    agent=consolidation_agent
)

task2 = Task(
    description="Create bar and line charts comparing branch performance.",
    expected_output="Charts comparing sales performance.",
    agent=chart_agent
)

task3 = Task(
    description="Write a summary report based on the consolidated data and charts.",
    expected_output="A final sales report.",
    agent=report_agent
)

# Define the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[consolidation_agent, chart_agent, report_agent],
    tasks=[task1, task2, task3],
    verbose=True
)

# Execute the crew
result = crew.kickoff()

print(result.raw)
```

This pipeline consolidates data, analyzes it, and generates the final report, ensuring a repeatable, structured process with minimal need for human intervention.

## **Comparing AI Agents and AI Pipelines**

#### **Advantages of AI Agents:**

1. **Interactivity**: AI agents can handle complex, open-ended tasks and adapt based on user responses, making them ideal for customer service or personal assistants.
    
2. **Context Awareness**: Agents can remember previous interactions, allowing them to make informed decisions based on past conversations.
    
3. **Flexibility**: Agents are not bound by a strict process, enabling them to dynamically navigate a range of potential scenarios.
    

#### **Advantages of AI Pipelines:**

1. **Predictability**: Pipelines follow a strict, deterministic flow, ensuring that results are consistent and repeatable each time.
    
2. **Modularity**: Pipelines can easily scale by adding or removing tasks, making them suitable for complex processes broken down into smaller, manageable steps.
    
3. **Efficiency**: For applications with repetitive tasks, pipelines offer a faster and more reliable approach than agents, which may introduce variability due to their adaptive nature.
    

## **Choosing the Right Approach**

* **Use AI Agents when** your application requires dynamic decision-making, interaction with users, or the ability to handle open-ended tasks. For example, an AI-powered customer support assistant or a virtual tutor would benefit from an agent's adaptive, interactive nature.
    
* **Use AI Pipelines when**: Your application involves predefined tasks that don’t change based on user interaction. Pipeline-based solutions are ideal for tasks like report generation, data processing, or repetitive workflows.
    

## **Building a Hybrid System**

In some cases, you may want to combine both approaches. For instance, you might use an AI agent to handle user interactions, gather inputs, and then pass the data to a pipeline that processes it and produces a structured output. Hybrid models offer the flexibility of agents with the reliability of pipelines.

#### **Hybrid Example: E-commerce Customer Support + Order Summary**

Imagine an e-commerce support system where an AI agent helps users track their orders and passes the information to a pipeline that generates an order summary once the order is located.

* **Agent Task**: The AI agent interacts with the customer, asking for order details (e.g., order number, shipping address).
    
* **Pipeline Task**: Once the order details are retrieved, a pipeline generates a detailed order summary and sends it to the customer.
    

Combining the two approaches can create a robust system that offers both interactivity and structure.

## **Conclusion: Choosing AI Agents or Pipelines**

Choosing between AI agents and AI pipelines depends on the nature of the task at hand. AI agents are ideal for complex, interactive scenarios that require flexibility, whereas AI pipelines offer a more structured and predictable approach to repetitive tasks. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each approach will help you design more effective and efficient AI-powered applications.
