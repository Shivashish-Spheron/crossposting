#### Ray’s unified compute framework consists of three layers:

1. **Ray AI Libraries**–An open-source, Python, domain-specific set of libraries that equip ML engineers, data scientists, and researchers with a scalable and unified toolkit for ML applications.
    
2. **Ray Core**–An open-source, Python, general purpose, distributed computing library that enables ML engineers and Python developers to scale Python applications and accelerate machine learning workloads.
    
3. **Ray Clusters**–A set of worker nodes connected to a common Ray head node. Ray clusters can be fixed-size, or they can autoscale up and down according to the resources requested by applications running on the cluster.
    

RAY's five native libraries are designed to handle specific machine-learning tasks:

1. **Data**: Provides scalable, framework-agnostic data loading and transformation for training, tuning, and prediction.
    
2. **Train**: Facilitates distributed multi-node and multi-core model training with fault tolerance, integrating seamlessly with popular training libraries.
    
3. **Tune**: Enables scalable hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
    
4. **Serve**: Offers scalable and programmable model serving for online inference, with optional microbatching to enhance performance.
    
5. **RLlib**: Supports scalable distributed reinforcement learning workloads.
    

These libraries cater to both data scientists and ML engineers. Data scientists can use them to scale individual workloads and entire ML applications. ML engineers benefit from scalable platform abstractions, simplifying the integration of tools from the broader ML ecosystem.

For custom applications, the Ray Core library allows Python developers to easily create scalable, distributed systems that can run on laptops, clusters, clouds, or Kubernetes. This core library serves as the foundation for Ray's AI libraries and third-party integrations within the Ray ecosystem.

RAY operates on any machine, cluster, cloud provider, or Kubernetes and boasts a growing ecosystem of community integrations.

## Comparison with Other Frameworks

Here's a comparison chart for Ray Framework with Spark, and Flink:

## Ray Use Cases

This page indexes common Ray use cases for scaling ML. It contains highlighted references to blogs, examples, and tutorials also located elsewhere in the Ray documentation.

### 1\. LLMs and Gen AI

Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI are rapidly changing industries, and demand compute at an astonishing pace. Ray provides a distributed compute framework for scaling these models, allowing developers to train and deploy models faster and more efficiently. With specialized libraries for data streaming, training, fine-tuning, hyperparameter tuning, and serving, Ray simplifies the process of developing and deploying large-scale AI models.

### 2\. Batch Inference

Batch inference is the process of generating model predictions on a large “batch” of input data. Ray for batch inference works with any cloud provider and ML framework, and is fast and cheap for modern deep learning applications. It scales from single machines to large clusters with minimal code changes. As a Python-first framework, you can easily express and interactively develop your inference workloads in Ray. To learn more about running batch inference with Ray, see the [batch inference guide](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/batch_inference.html#batch-inference-home).

### 3\. Model Serving

[Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html#rayserve) is well suited for model composition, enabling you to build a complex inference service consisting of multiple ML models and business logic all in Python code.

It supports complex [model deployment patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM4hJLelzSw) requiring the orchestration of multiple Ray actors, where different actors provide inference for different models. Serve handles both batch and online inference and can scale to thousands of models in production.

### 4\. Hyperparameter Tuning

The [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html#tune-main) library enables any parallel Ray workload to be run under a hyperparameter tuning algorithm.

Running multiple hyperparameter tuning experiments is a pattern apt for distributed computing because each experiment is independent of one another. Ray Tune handles the hard bit of distributing hyperparameter optimization and makes available key features such as checkpointing the best result, optimizing scheduling, and specifying search patterns.
