The emergence of Web3 signals a new era for the online space that confronts and solves critical issues prevalent in the present-day internet and the wider economy. Web3 is intrinsically linked to DLT technologies, predominantly blockchain-based and cryptocurrencies. It aims to provide netizens with inherent privacy, enabling them to monetize their data, content, and activity and to collaborate outside big tech- and government-controlled environments. Web3 represents a crucial step towards a more decentralized, transparent, and efficient internet, and there is no doubt that it will soon become the new norm.

Online content marketplaces had some significant shortcomings in the past. Platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Spotify grew too large, leading to a monopoly. However, Web3 now offers solutions to the challenges of Web2. For instance, DIMO provides a viable alternative to Uber, and Hivemapper aims to create a more accessible and community-driven version of Google Maps. Spheron, a Web3 infrastructure platform that provides tools and services to decentralize cloud storage and computing, is an alternative to AWS. These alternatives are worth exploring to see how they differ from traditional apps.

## In this article, we compile 7 web3 alternatives to web2 platforms

The centralization vs. decentralization debate is the fundamental difference between Web3 and Web2. In the Web2 world, the architecture, applications, and information are centralized on systems like the cloud and server, which anyone with access to them can easily alter. But, Web3 is a decentralized internet that empowers individuals with authority over their identity and assets, enabling them to conduct business online directly. As a result, Web3 platforms are becoming fierce competitors to Web2 platforms. So, here are some Web3 replacements that can be used instead of traditional Web2 platforms.

### **1\.** [**Audius**](https://audius.co/)**: Alternative to Spotify**

[![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1710328431690/a8126a33-e075-441b-b617-365619e2e143.png align="center")](https://audius.co/)

Audius is the ultimate decentralized music platform for artists who crave to take control of their music and profits. With its unique offerings, Audius allows artists to earn an impressive **90% of their sales revenues**, fully own their content, and decide how to monetize their music without interference.

Audius is based on a peer-to-peer network and supported by decentralized node operators. The platform is also backed by a governance token, [$AUDIO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/audius/), that serves as its foundation, with a market cap of **$414,179,028**.

[![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1710329993824/8e52b103-b730-4470-a140-3152e43c2d9a.png align="center")](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/audius/)

This decentralization empowers artists to connect directly with their fans and claim a significant share. However, Audius does have its limitations, such as a limited catalog and brand recognition and the inability to provide copyright support due to its decentralized nature. Despite these limitations, Audius remains the top choice for artists who seek ultimate control over their music and revenue.

### **2\.** [**Presearch**](https://presearch.io/)**: Advanced Google alternative search engine**

[![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1710328492039/e32b51ed-eb67-4def-8f04-3dd14e1cff7d.png align="center")](https://presearch.io/)

Presearch is a revolutionary search engine that offers its users a diversified search experience. Unlike Google, Presearch allows users to switch between multiple search engines and platforms, enabling a more comprehensive and personalized search experience. Powered by blockchain technology, Presearch rewards users with PRE tokens for each search made.

Nevertheless, remember that these tokens can only be withdrawn once the user reaches a balance of 1000 PRE. Furthermore, the platform limits users to 30 searches per day but still allows users to earn up to 3 PRE daily. This decentralization approach to search engines is a vital feature of the Web3 movement, which ensures that no single entity can dominate the search results, making Presearch a fairer and more democratic alternative to Google.

### 3\. Web3 emails: E2EE protection Dmail

Email is an essential but outdated web service that has been around for ages. Even though messaging apps have taken over as the preferred means of communication, email is here to stay. However, web2 email services have a bad reputation for spam, phishing, security breaches, and privacy violations. While user experience does depend on the provider, the privacy cost of legacy email accounts also varies significantly.

[![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1710328656157/2930fe2c-7cc5-4f94-9765-d2617541c329.png align="center")](https://dmail.ai/)

One way to avoid doubts is to switch to a Web3 email service, like [Dmail](https://dmail.ai/). Dmail is a collaborative platform that integrates messaging, data storage, workspace, and decentralized identity (DID) for Web3 users. It uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE), differentiating it from most Web2 services.

With E2EE, messages remain private from intermediaries and can only be decrypted by the recipient. If you value your privacy and want to avoid such malpractice, E2EE-based web3 email services are worth considering. Dmail is just one of many web3 mailbox providers, including Tildamail, Ledgermail, Hashmail, Mailchain, Ethermail, Metamail, and more.

### 4\. Spheron Network: Limitless Computing Power Just a Click Away

[**Spheron Network**](https://spheron.network/) is a Web3 infrastructure platform that provides tools and services to decentralize cloud storage and computing.

### 5\. [Odysee](https://app.spheron.network/#/signup): Ownership of the content

Google's YouTube platform dom[i](https://blog.spheron.network/deploy-an-avail-node-in-minutes-using-spheron-compute)nates the video-sharing market with over 75% market share, while its competitors, including Vimeo, lag far behind.

[![top visited websites of the world](https://recurpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Frame-143.png align="center")](https://recurpost.com/blog/youtube-statistics/)

Despite its widespread popularity, YouTube has long been accused of censorship[,](https://arbitrum.io/) account takedowns, and pushing selective narratives. Moreover, YouTube has been caught illegally collecting personal information from children, leading to a record [$170 million settlement](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/09/google-youtube-will-pay-record-170-million-alleged-violations-childrens-privacy-law) in 2019.

For those who value privacy and want more control over their content, web3 video-sharing platforms like Odysee might be a better fit. Odysee is a blockchain-based video platform that runs on the [LBRY protocol](https://lbry.com/faq/what-is-lbry) and offers users earning opportunities through native LBRY Credits (LBC)cryptocurrency.

### 6\. [Status](https://status.app/): Why Stick with Legacy Messaging Apps? Web3 Alternatives Offer Privacy without Eavesdropping

The big players dominate messaging apps, and it's disappointing that Google has no say in this domain. Meta, the owner of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, commands the market in many parts of the world. While WhatsApp boasts a userbase of about [2 billion](https://blog.whatsapp.com/two-billion-users-connecting-the-world-privately) â€“ over twice as many as Facebook Messenger, the downsides of Messenger are well-known, as it's part of a social media behemoth devouring user data in excessive amounts.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1710331503557/d7d347b0-0d0c-4f8d-8c0b-e06de1f9b635.png align="center")

If you're concerned about privacy and security, it's worth exploring web3 alternatives like [Status](https://status.app/), which offers 100% privacy in a peer-to-peer environment.

[![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1710328974228/874da9f8-442e-4f5e-a07a-eb98eb26cd06.png align="center")](https://status.app/)

As an app that combines a secure messaging service, a crypto wallet, and a web3 browser, Status is a young but promising tool. It is entirely immune to censorship and supports worldwide payments within the app. The messenger's non-custodial crypto wallet allows you to store and send all [ERC20 tokens](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum/), including SNT (Status Network Token) and ERC721 tokens (an NFT standard).

If you're looking for more web3 messengers, you can check out [**Secretum**](https://solana.com/ecosystem/secretum)**,** [**Nansen Connect**](https://www.nansen.ai/)**,** [**0XChat**](https://0xchat.com/#/)**, and** [**BChat**](https://bchat.beldex.io/), all of which offer similar features.

### 7\. [Brave](https://brave.com/en-in/) Web3 Browsers: Private Way to Access Dapps

It is alarming to realize Google's overwhelming dominance in providing basic online services, including Web2 browsers. Chrome's market share has already surpassed a staggering [65.4% worldwide](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide). This is partially due to Google-owned Android's monopoly in the mobile OS market (around 72%), but Chrome also holds a whopping 66% of the market share in desktop browsers.

[![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1710331687361/287e26e4-8aea-4d59-ba48-810019dd9276.png align="center")](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide)

Despite the availability of alternatives such as [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?ep=313&form=MA13M0&es=40), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/in/safari/), or [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), none can be considered a perfect fit for the "next web" model to the extent that native web3 browsers can.

One example is [Brave](https://brave.com/en-in/), a free, open-source, Chromium-based web3 browser with a built-in wallet and crypto rewards, released in November 2019. With enhanced privacy features, including automatic blocking of website trackers and online ads, Brave enables users to buy, send, store, and swap thousands of assets, including NFTs, on over 100 blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Filecoin, and more.

[![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1710329314960/b1dccc5e-1211-4d9e-bb8a-663a0829155e.png align="center")](https://brave.com/en-in/)

[Brave](https://brave.com/en-in/) also offers a game-changing feature that allows users to earn money through Basic Attention Tokens [(BAT) cryptocurrency](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) by turning on optional ads.

## Conclusion

The examples shared above only scratch the surface of the incredible solutions that the web3 space has to offer. From music streaming to professional networks, remote work to crowdfunding, insurance to gaming, and even no-code web development and dating, web3 offers a plethora of digital tools and platforms that cater to various niches. It's imperative that you explore these niches and determine which web paradigm and service aligns with your needs and preferences.

In doing so, you must consider the value of your privacy, data, and activity online. Unlike web2 platforms, web3 providers empower you to control and monetize your data, while web2 platforms tend to exploit your identity and creativity for their exclusive gain. Therefore, it's essential that you prioritize your privacy and security online by choosing web3 platforms over their outdated counterparts.
