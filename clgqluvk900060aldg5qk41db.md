Are you new to the tech community and wondering how to access content on the IPFS network using your domain name? Spheron simplifies this process by allowing you to use customized URLs for IPFS Gateway services. In this article, we will guide you through setting up an IPFS node using Spheron Compute and using your custom domain to Whitelabel IPFS Gateway.

## How to set up an IPFS Node using Spheron Compute?

Setting up an IPFS node using Spheron Compute is a straightforward process. With Spheron Compute, you can quickly deploy an IPFS node and access its features like IPFS Web Interface and IPFS Gateway.

To get started, follow these simple steps:

1. Go to the Compute section in Spheron.
    
2. Create a new cluster by clicking on the "New Cluster" button.
    
3. Click on the "Select from marketplace app" button for fast-track deployment.
    
4. Select the IPFS template from the marketplace.
    
5. Choose your instance plan and click on the "Deploy" button.
    

Once your IPFS node is up and running, you can upload files to IPFS via WebUI or HTTP-Client, and access files using IPFS Gateway. Letâ€™s take a look at how that works.

## Upload files to IPFS

### Using IPFS WebUI

If you are new to IPFS, you might wonder how to manage your files on the network. Luckily, IPFS provides an easy-to-use Web interface that makes it simple for anyone to add, pin, and share files. Whether you're a developer or a less experienced user, the interface has all the functionality you need to get started.

By default, the IPFS Web interface is configured on port 5001. To access the IPFS Web interface, simply click on the URL corresponding to internal port 5001 from your instance page. Then, add '/webui' to the end of the URL, and you're ready to go! With the IPFS Web interface, you can easily manage your content on the IPFS network.

### Using IPFS Client SDK

The `ipfs-http-client` is a powerful package that simplifies the entire process, allowing you to effortlessly upload files to your IPFS node from your app with just a few simple steps.

* First, install the package by running `npm install ipfs-http-client`.
    
* Then, use the create method to connect to your IPFS node. Replace with your IPFS node URL corresponding to internal port 5001.
    

```javascript
const ipfs = create({
    url: `http://${your-ipfs-url}/api/v0`,
});
```

* With the version and id methods, you can easily retrieve information about your node.
    

```javascript
const version = await ipfs.version();
const id = await ipfs.id();
```

* Finally, use the add method to upload files directly to your node.
    

```javascript
const uploadedFile = await ipfs.add(file, {
    progress: (prog) => console.log(`received: ${prog}`),
});

const fileHash = uploadedFile.cid.toString();
```

### Access files using IPFS Gateway

If you are looking for a way to easily access content stored on the IPFS network without installing any special software, IPFS Gateway has got you covered! As a user, you can use the Gateway to access content via HTTP requests. It acts as a bridge between the IPFS network and the traditional internet, making it easy to access content from anywhere.

By default, the IPFS gateway is configured on port 8080. To start, click on the URL corresponding to internal port 8080 from your instance page. Once you're there, you can copy the CID of your file, add the prefix `/ipfs/your-cid` to the end of the URL, and voila! You can now access your file directly from the IPFS network. It's that simple!
