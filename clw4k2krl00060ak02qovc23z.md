However, this approach has become outdated with the recent explosion of the gaming market, with a particular focus on cloud-based gaming services.

The centralized cloud providers are considerably strained due to the massive influx of new users, leading to network congestion and suboptimal performance. It is high time to implement edge computing to improve gaming performance by moving the cloud infrastructure physically closer to the user. The GPUs that render and process the gaming experience must be decentralized using edge computing. This approach is way more effective than just basing data centers in a country's capital city and a few other metropolitan areas.

## Case Studies Show Edge Computing's Role in Gaming Latency Reduction

Edge technology case studies unequivocally demonstrate the superior gaming performance optimization results that can be achieved, especially in comparison to traditional cloud computing. As per [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/), a leader in the industry, edge computing can process data in real-time, unlike cloud computing, which is non-time sensitive and leads to inevitable delays with centralized clouds.

Regarding cloud gaming, gaming edge computing can easily resolve latency issues. The distance between cloud servers and users is a major factor in latency issues. The data needs to travel from the processing device to the player, and even a few tens of milliseconds of latency can result in a poor gaming experience.

A fast web connection alone won't cut it for game streaming. Cloud services need top-notch hardware to maximize user connectivity. If the service provider's hardware isn't up to the mark, users can experience lag despite having a good internet connection. However, distance is another key factor that needs to be addressed.

Cloud networks must be closer to users for an impeccable gaming experience. Gaming edge computing offers the shortest route from the cloud to the user, minimizing latency. The decentralized cloud infrastructure of edge computing moves processing power to the network's edge, thus ensuring low latency.

The gaming industry is increasingly exploring edge computing solutions because of its superiority over traditional clouds. Aethir, a decentralized cloud infrastructure provider, already has deals with over 10 high-profile gaming studios, which is a testament to the growing prominence of gaming edge computing.

## Improving Online Gaming Experience Through Cutting-Edge Technology

Multiplayer online games are completely different from their single-player counterparts. While single-player cloud gaming demands efficient streaming to a single user, multiplayer games require providers to effectively stream shared experiences to multiple users simultaneously. In these cases, the cloud infrastructure must deliver a much more demanding, lag-free experience, making lag an even bigger issue in multiplayer games than in single-player titles.

To put it another way, imagine playing a [Call of Duty](https://www.callofduty.com/) or [Fortnite](https://www.fortnite.com/) match and the game suffering a half-second delay while you have the opponent in your crosshairs. You’re about to drop them at one moment, but in the next, you’re the one getting dropped because of network lag. Such experiences infuriate players but can often happen due to high latency.

But now, enhancing multiplayer online games with edge technology is no longer a pipe dream—it's a realistic possibility. Gaming companies have the power to implement successful gaming technologies that leverage edge computing, which can effectively improve multiplayer gaming and eliminate frustrating latency and network congestion.

Furthermore, gaming edge computing allows studios to introduce advanced Web 3.0 features such as blockchain-based microtransactions with cryptocurrency. This technology can leverage cryptocurrencies instead of relying on slow and complex centralized payment channels, making gaming transactions more streamlined and efficient. The compatibility of edge computing with blockchain technology is ideal for tokenizing in-game items like weapon skins as NFTs, revolutionizing how we perceive and interact with gaming.

## Maximizing Gaming Performance for Top AAA Titles

AAA titles are the pinnacle of video gaming, and their development costs can soar up to tens of millions of US dollars. These games generate billions of dollars in revenue, accounting for most of the gaming industry. [Grand Theft Auto V, for instance, made nearly 800 million USD on its first day of global sales](https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/grand-theft-auto-v-earns-800-million-in-a-day-more-than-worldwide-haul-of-man-of-steel-1200616706/), making it one of the most successful games in history.

The success of AAA titles is crucial to the gaming industry, and studios that develop them can't afford to lose profits due to game streaming infrastructure issues. Games like Valorant, for example, have millions of users who depend on adequate cloud gaming infrastructure.

[Valorant's](https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/) popularity has significantly increased scalability demands, and Riot Games, the developer of Valorant, chose one of the largest global centralized cloud providers for game streaming services. However, to keep up with the game's performance, the provider had to introduce server Outposts - edge computing mini-servers positioned at the edge of the cloud network to provide increased scalability and effectively solve latency issues.

This case shows that even big-tech cloud providers are beginning to realize the potential of edge computing as the future of cloud solutions. The importance of shifting from traditional cloud to implementing edge computing for gaming performance improvement cannot be overstated.
