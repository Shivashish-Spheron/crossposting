The Nvidia RTX 4090 is a highly dependable and powerful GPU tailored for the PC gaming market, but it also excels in machine learning and AI/ML, Computing, deep learning tasks. For data scientists, AI researchers, or developers seeking a GPU with exceptional deep learning performance, the RTX 4090 is a superb option.

The RTX 4090 is a top-tier GPU utilizing the Ada Lovelace architecture. Featuring 16,384 CUDA cores and 512 Turing Tensor Cores, this GPU boasts immense computing power, making it well-suited for intricate deep-learning projects. It's perfect for challenging tasks such as facial recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision.

## The transition from NVLink to PCIe 4.0

Nvidia has decided to replace the [NVLink bridge](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/design-visualization/nvlink-bridges/) with [PCIe 4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express) for the latest RTX 4000 series, catering to gamers, creators, and workstation users. Despite being placed in a PCIe 5.0 slot, it will operate with PCIe 4.0 due to backward compatibility.

Before the launch, [Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang) announced the discontinuation of the NVLink bridge and introduced PCIe Gen 5 as its successor. Nvidia asserts that this new connection is sufficiently fast for linking multiple GPUs, with the space formerly used by the NVLink connector now allocated for additional AI computing capabilities.

**Huang explained, "The reason why we removed NVLink was that we needed the I/Os for other purposes, so we utilized the I/O area to maximize AI processing capacity."**
