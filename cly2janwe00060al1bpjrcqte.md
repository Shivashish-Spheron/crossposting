AMD has unveiled its ROCm 6.1.3 software suite, featuring new AI enhancements and expanded support, alongside the introduction of the Radeon PRO W7900 Dual Slot GPU.

## ROCm 6.1.3 Software Stack Adds Multi-GPU, TensorFlow, and WSL 2 Support

At [Computex 2024](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/events/computex.html), AMD announced the retail availability of the [Radeon PRO W7900](https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/workstations/radeon-pro/w7900.html) Dual Slot GPU, priced at **$3499 USD**. This GPU is designed for superior performance in AI-intensive tasks, boasting a 48 GB memory capacity to enhance speed in large language models (LLMs).

The Radeon PRO W7900 features a dual-slot design, ideal for workstations that can accommodate up to four of these powerful units. The Navi 31 XTX GPU core powers the card with 6144 cores across 96 compute units. It has a 384-bit wide bus and 48 GB of GDDR6 memory, delivering up to 864 GB/s bandwidth. Additionally, the card includes 96 MB of Infinity Cache for even higher bandwidth performance.

### **Key Features:**

* **High Performance**: Equipped with 96 compute units, 192 AI accelerators, and 96 ray accelerators, achieving up to 61.32 TFLOPs at peak single precision (FP32) and 122.64 TFLOPS at peak half precision (FP16).
    
* **Cost Efficiency**: Offers up to 38% better performance-per-dollar in Llama 3 70B Q4 compared to competitors, capable of handling the 70B parameter model on a single GPU framebuffer.
    
* **Exceptional Memory**: 48GB memory with error-correcting code (ECC) technology ensures data integrity, facilitating seamless multitasking and complex project handling.
    
* **Desktop AI Capability**: Supports up to four AMD Radeon PRO W7900 Dual Slot graphics cards, adding significant AI performance to desktop IT infrastructures, ideal for sensitive and mission-critical projects.
