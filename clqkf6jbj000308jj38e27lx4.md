We can see that there is a divide in the web3 community. On the one hand, some people are fully invested in the development of web3 and are contributing a lot of energy towards it. Unfortunately, this group is small but powerful because they have truth on their side. We refer to this group as the "real" web3 community.

On the other hand, some people are not as interested in web3 development and are more focused on their self-interests. These people are either intentionally or unintentionally causing chaos within the web3 world. While not everything is obvious on the surface, a few things are happening in the market that demonstrate this.

Lastly, a majority of people do not really have a strong opinion and are mainly interested in following the trend. Individuals must decide which group they want to align themselves with.

Despite this division, web3 is growing both economically and socially. The DAOs market and philosophy clearly indicate that the web3 community is ready to progress. Although there are some questions and uncertainties, we want to focus on the technological aspect of web3. When referring to "web3", we primarily speak about the underlying technology.

## Web3 Lego

The development of decentralized applications (dApps) and web3 applications has brought about a new technological frontier, but some challenges need to be addressed. It has come to our attention that most dApps are not entirely decentralized, as they contain centralized parts or depend on centralized services for decentralized elements. The complexities of the architecture, including the backend, frontend, middleware, and user data, require meticulous attention to deploy them using various services.

Creating web3 applications involves a significant level of technical expertise and specific skill sets on the part of developers, who must contend with the intricacies of integrating different centralized and decentralized parts. Building a web3 application can be compared to constructing a Lego structure. You start with individual blocks (centralized or decentralized components) and connect them to build a cohesive, functional whole. Just as Legos come in different shapes and sizes, each component in a web3 application has its unique features and functions, which must be integrated carefully to create a stable and efficient system.

One of the significant challenges facing web3 applications is the potential for a few centralized services, such as centralized hosting providers [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in), or [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en), to shut down the entire system within an hour. Furthermore, user accounts are controlled by web3 companies rather than users or DAO, making them susceptible to control and compromise by specific individuals.

Currently, hundreds of developers are grappling with these issues one-on-one. Becoming a web3 developer requires the ability to navigate these challenges, as well as a specific set of skill sets.

## Is Web3 Just an Extension of Web2?

The current scenario in web3 presents a dilemma for projects: either opt for cost-effective and user-friendly centralized web2 services or navigate the more expensive, less scalable, and less transparent web3 alternatives. Many aspects of web3 still lack viable alternatives to established web2 services.

Businesses face a crucial decision: compromise and develop a product utilizing existing options or wait for the web3 market to offer better alternatives. Predictably, many businesses are choosing the former.

Beyond this choice, web3 applications encounter various technological challenges such as scaling issues, speed concerns, high transaction and storage costs, subpar user experiences for both developers and users, security vulnerabilities, and more. Remarkably, these problems often go unaddressed or under-discussed by significant market players. This compromise-driven approach might eventually lead to severe issues for the entire market, akin to hastily written code that crashes when faced with increased demand.

Regrettably, there's a notable lack of active discourse or attention to these uncomfortable but essential questions on platforms like Reddit or Twitter. It's an overlooked topic that few are willing to broach.

One undeniable reality remains: the overwhelming majority of web3 applications we currently utilize cannot be deemed truly web3. Period.

## How can we utilize the true potential of Web3?

The current state of web3 development is characterized by distinct technological layers, with blockchain developers competing on metrics such as transactions per second, block completion time, and transaction cost. However, relying on centralized services for hosting frontends, storing user data, and providing access to the blockchain undermines the decentralization that web3 promises.

We can propose an unpopular solution for blockchain scaling called sharding, which many modern blockchains have since adopted. However, even with sharding, we can recognize the limitations of this approach and design a multi-layer blockchain platform to address these issues.

As web3 applications became more complex, it became clear that keeping all components decentralized was a major challenge. After studying numerous projects, technological solutions, and research, we found none addressed the problem comprehensively. Existing solutions only maintained decentralization within their own layer, leaving the rest of the application vulnerable to centralization.

To overcome this limitation, we conceived the idea of Decentralized Infrastructure (DeInfra), a new infrastructure class capable of housing all aspects of a web3 application without reliance on centralized services. Whether it's related to hosting, storage, or compute. This approach eliminates the need for intermediaries and ensures true decentralization across the entire application.

DeInfra may seem like a complex solution, but its simplicity lies in its ability to address the fundamental issue of decentralization in web3 development. By providing a holistic infrastructure, DeInfra offers a genuine path toward achieving the vision of a truly decentralized web3 ecosystem.

## What is Decentralized Infrastructure?

DeInfra represents "Decentralized Infrastructure," creating a platform where every component of a web3 application can exist within a unified decentralized environment. It's an advanced framework that empowers the development and deployment of comprehensive web3 applications, offering capabilities that transcend those of standard smart contracts.

This approach signifies a significant leap in decentralization, security, and scalability compared to traditional Layer 1 blockchain. DeInfra marks the next phase in the organic progression of the Web3 landscape.

## Key Principles of the DeInfra
