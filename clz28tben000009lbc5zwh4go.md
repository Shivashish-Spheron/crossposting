When discussing the convergence of AI and cryptocurrency, the most prominent projects are those tackling data collection, GPU computation, or data inference within the AI realm. Notable examples include Akash Network and Ritual Net, which distinguish themselves in the expansive AI industry by utilizing decentralization, incentivization, censorship resistance, and privacy offered by Web3.

Despite these projects innovative applications, their impact on everyday Web3 users remains limited, and they haven't significantly attracted new users to the Web3 ecosystem.

## The Emergence of AI Agents

With the swift expansion of Web3, an increasing number of crypto protocols, tokens, and applications are emerging, creating a complex landscape that can overwhelm even seasoned users. This has led to a growing trend of developing AI Agentsâ€”intelligent assistants designed to simplify the use of crypto apps. These AI Agents bridge the gap between crypto and AI, addressing the challenging user experience (UX) issues in crypto. Envision a future where you could instruct an AI agent to perform on-chain tasks, and it would autonomously execute the necessary transactions.

AI Agents aim to establish an intelligence layer atop the existing DeFi infrastructure, functioning akin to bankers, investors, traders, and fund managers in the traditional finance sector, but within the Web3 context. These agents will leverage foundational DeFi components to execute on-chain transactions.

Integrating DeFi and AI promises advanced applications such as AI-driven lending, intelligent yield farming strategies, automated market making, and AI-assisted portfolio management. Beyond DeFi, AI Agents could enhance the gaming industry by providing users with assistants and pets that aid in-game navigation, thereby improving the overall gaming experience.

## Categorizing AI Agents

### **1\. Autonomous Portfolio Managers**

These AI Agents manage a pool of assets from various user profiles, aiming to maximize returns by allocating assets across different DeFi strategies using off-chain AI data streams. This service is essentially portfolio management powered by AI. To ensure minimal trust is required, projects incorporate zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to validate the AI's inferences on-chain.

### **2\. Prompt-based AI Agents**

Imagine a future where you could simply tell an AI agent what you want to achieve on-chain, and it would automatically compose and execute the necessary transactions. This is the vision for most AI Agent projects, with an anticipated future where prompt-based interactions become the preferred method for users to engage with blockchains.

Projects like Wayfinder, Brian Knows, and Aperture Finance are developing ChatGPT-like interfaces to facilitate knowledgeable blockchain transactions through conversational AI agents. These protocols utilize large language models (LLMs) to convert user prompts and intents into executable transactions.

### **3\. Gaming AI Agents**

Teams like Parallel Colony are developing gaming AI Agents that enrich the gaming experience. These agents operate within Web3 environments, interacting with players and game elements through on-chain smart contracts. They can act on behalf of the user or as in-game assistants/pets, capable of interacting and trading assets with other agents.

Some games, both Web2 and Web3, use AI to create dynamic non-playable characters (NPCs). However, this discussion focuses on AI Agents that can trade and act on user's behalf.

## Detailed Overview of AI Agent Protocols

### [**1\. Wayfinder**](https://cache.wayfinder.ai/)
