Artificial Intelligence (AI) is evolving rapidly, and one of the most exciting frontiers in this field is **multimodal AI**. This technology allows models to process and interpret information from different modalities, such as text, images, and audio. Two of the leading contenders in the multimodal AI space are [**LLaMA 3.2 90B Vision**](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-3-2-connect-2024-vision-edge-mobile-devices/) and [**GPT-4**](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/). Both models have shown tremendous potential in understanding and generating responses across various data formats, but how do they compare?

This article will examine both models, exploring their strengths and weaknesses and where each one excels in real-world applications.

## **What Is Multimodal AI?**

Multimodal AI refers to systems capable of simultaneously processing and analyzing multiple types of data—like text, images, and sound. This ability is crucial for AI to understand context and provide richer, more accurate responses. For example, in a medical diagnosis, the AI might process both patient records (text) and X-rays (images) to give a comprehensive evaluation.

Multimodal AI can be found in many fields such as autonomous driving, robotics, and content creation, making it an indispensable tool in modern technology.

## **Overview of LLaMA 3.2 90B Vision**

**LLaMA 3.2 90B Vision** is the latest iteration of the LLaMA series, designed specifically to handle complex multimodal tasks. With a whopping 90 billion parameters, this model is fine-tuned to specialize in both language and vision, making it highly effective in tasks that require image recognition and understanding.

One of its key features is its ability to process high-resolution images and perform tasks like object detection, scene recognition, and even image captioning with high accuracy. LLaMA 3.2 stands out due to its specialization in visual data, making it a go-to choice for AI projects that need heavy lifting in image processing.

**Advantages:**
