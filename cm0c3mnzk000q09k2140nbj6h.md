Since the public introduction of LLM and AI chatbot technologies in 2023, the demand for high-performance computing has skyrocketed. [A detailed analysis of the training compute requirements (measured in FLOPs)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05924) of significant machine learning systems reveals a dramatic increase in computational needs. Between 1952 and 2010, compute requirements doubled every 18 months. However, between 2010 and 2022, this doubling time accelerated to just six months. From late 2015 to 2022, a new trend of large-scale models emerged, with compute needs starting two to three orders of magnitude above previous levels, exhibiting a ten-month doubling time.

As the competition for processing power intensifies among companies and nations, many overlook the vast potential of underutilized processors scattered across the globe, already connected to the Internet and ready for use.

[Kaisar](https://kaisar.io/) is at the forefront of this innovative DePIN movement, developing a Layer 1 (L1) interoperable blockchain with fast, low-cost transaction speeds, ideally suited for DePIN projects. Complementing this, Kaisar offers a DePIN platform with pre-built container templates that simplify the training and scaling of custom AIs based on some of today's most advanced models.

## Leading the DePIN Market

Kaisar employs Proof of Physical Work technology, with governance facilitated by its native KAI token. This system rewards machines that contribute processing power and DePIN builders who generate transactions on the network, fostering a decentralized, positive-sum economy.

As an L1 solution, Kaisar's blockchain is fully decentralized, with a robust consensus mechanism to prevent fraud. The network supports micropayments for transaction fees and provider rewards, enabling anyone to join by simply downloading the Kaisar app, bypassing cumbersome application processes.

Kaisar distinguishes itself from competitors by being an L1 network seamlessly compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Unlike many competitors operating on Layer 2 (L2) solutions, Kaisar’s network is Polkadot-enabled and supports cross-chain machine IDs with Cosmos, Solana, and Binance and bridges to Ethereum. Moreover, it connects to over 30 blockchains via Wormhole, offering best-in-class interoperability.

From a user's perspective, scalability is crucial whether they are selling compute cycles or developing a DePIN product. Kaisar’s network can process over 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), with transaction costs as low as $0.00025.

Kaisar also provides a comprehensive suite of modular, ready-to-use DePIN functions. These include self-sovereign machine IDs, seamless payment processing for machines, data storage and verification, data indexing, and autonomous AI agents, ensuring that DePIN projects and dApps have all the tools they need to operate effectively.

## Behind the Technology: How Kaisar Operates

Kaisar’s network, powered by its blockchain, offers a secure and efficient platform for customers seeking affordable computational power. These customers can access processing power from providers who earn rewards for sharing the unused cycles of their processors.

Customers specify their requirements — such as processor type, geographic location, and bandwidth — to create a compute cluster and submit their request to Kaisar’s smart contract. Once payment is made using KAI tokens, the smart contract identifies suitable devices and automatically sets up the cluster. After deployment, detailed information about the cluster is sent to the customer, who can connect and use it.

The process is straightforward for providers looking to share their processors and earn rewards. After installing tools to monitor device information (e.g., CPU/GPU type, bandwidth, and RAM), the device is verified and registered with Kaisar’s smart contract. The device is then made available on the Kaisar Network to execute jobs. Activity reports are sent to Kaisar, and the smart contract compensates the provider based on a predefined algorithm.

Rather than a centralized cloud service company mediating the relationship between customers and providers, the Kaisar blockchain facilitates direct, secure connections. The device contract manages the registration and operation of CPU/GPU devices, the cluster manager contract approves customer orders and deploys clusters, and the emission contract handles provider rewards. Users can extend cluster usage, deregister devices, or raise technical issues as needed.

## Architecture

[Kaisar Network's architecture](https://docs.kaisar.io/kaisar-network/architecture) is a cohesive, multi-layered structure that delivers a seamless, secure, and efficient user experience. Each layer has a distinct role and works in tandem to ensure optimal system performance. The architecture is built on modern technology, ensuring scalability, reliability, and robustness.

### Workflow

**1\. Checking:** The Checker sends a job request to verify the uptime and performance of the Worker.

**2\. PoPW (Proof of Physical Work):** The Provider executes the job and sends proof of work to the Checker.

**3\. Report:** The Checker reports the parameters and performance data of the Providers to the blockchain.

**4\. Reward:** At the end of each epoch, the system issues rewards to Providers and Checkers based on performance and honesty.

### Components

* **Blockchain**: Kaisar leverages peaq blockchain, a multi-chain layer one blockchain specifically designed and optimized for DePIN. The network can scale beyond 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) (pending upgrade) while maintaining a minimal transaction cost of approximately $0.00025. Peaq utilizes the most environmentally friendly blockchain architecture and boasts the second-largest developer ecosystem in Web3. Peaq enables seamless interaction with Polkadot, cross-chain machine IDs with Cosmos, Solana, and Binance, and connection to Ethereum. peaq blockchain is EVM compatible and connected to over 30 blockchains through Wormhole.
    
* **Kaisar Checker**: As a Checker Node, Kaisar Checker is responsible for assessing the uptime, bandwidth, and performance of physical devices provided by Providers within the VPN network. Upon completion of tests, Checkers transmit proof of device functionality to Kaisar Blockchain. Periodically, Kaisar Blockchain evaluates Checker performance and efficiency to allocate rewards.
    
* **End-users**: End-users are those seeking to rent GPUs within the Kaisar Network. They directly engage with Kaisar Blockchain to access GPU rental, payment processing, and cancellation features.
    
* **Providers**: Providers offer CPU/GPU physical devices for the Kaisar Network. These devices interact with the Kaisar Blockchain to execute various functions, including device registration and reward retrieval.
    

## Roles in Kaisar Network

Kaisar Network integrates three essential roles for its [operations](https://docs.kaisar.io/kaisar-network/roles-in-kaisar-network): Container, Manager, and Checker.

* **Container:** These act as specialized computers that handle heavy computational tasks, including validating transactions, displaying digital content, and providing remote rendering services. These tasks are performed in real-time, which is essential for a seamless cloud experience.
    
* **Manager:** This role facilitates the connection between users and Containers, helping them select and use the most suitable Containers for different application requirements.
    
* **Checker:** Checkers evaluate the performance and service quality of Containers by continuously monitoring them to ensure they operate correctly and effectively.
    

## The KAI Token: Powering a Decentralized Compute Economy

In an era where meme tokens can be created with minimal effort, the KAI token will launch with significant utility. KAI is the native utility token of the Kaisar ecosystem, a multifaceted asset designed not only for transactions but also for incentivization, governance, and platform development. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens, Kaisar has meticulously strategized its allocation to ensure optimal ecosystem growth and balance stakeholders' short—and long-term interests.

The KAI native token plays a multifunctional role in the ecosystem:

* **Transaction utilities:** KAI serves as the standard medium of exchange in Kaisar. KAI tokens are used for transactions within the Kaisar Network and its AI cluster system. Customers use KAI tokens to pay for computing resources, and providers receive KAI tokens in return for offering those resources.
    
* **Incentives and rewards:** Providers, Checkers, Validators, and future contributors earn KAI tokens for their contributions to the network, ensuring active participation and maintaining the system's integrity. This reward mechanism encourages continuous involvement and support from the community, driving the network's growth and efficiency.
    
* **Governance:** Token holders are empowered to propose, discuss, and vote on platform changes, ensuring Kaisar maintains its decentralized character.
    
* **Staking:** New node operators who want to contribute to the Kaisar ecosystem must stake KAI tokens as an initial commitment. In addition to demonstrating commitment, staked KAI tokens safeguard against potential wrongdoing. Node operators engaging in fraudulent practices that violate Kaisar Network's standards or experiencing errors that affect the system risk having their staked KAI tokens partially or completely forfeited.

## [Token Emission Plan](https://docs.kaisar.io/tokenomics/token-emissions)

The token rewards within the network are distributed with the creation of each block, benefiting Providers, Validators, and Nominators over 12 years. This reward system is structured around a deflationary model, which adjusts every 10,512,000 blocks, roughly corresponding to four years. Initially, the reward rate is set at 15 KAI per block for the first four years.

This will then be reduced to 13 KAI for the following four years and 11 KAI for the last four years. This reduction will continue until the total emission reaches its cap of 1,000,000,000 KAI. After this limit is reached, rewards will shift to being funded by transaction fees, compensating Validators and Nominators, and cluster rental fees, which will reward Providers and Checkers.
