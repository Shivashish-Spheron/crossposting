[Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](https://blog.spheron.network/understanding-nfts-exploring-the-world-of-non-fungible-tokens) have taken the world by storm, revolutionizing the way we perceive digital ownership and value. As the NFT landscape continues to evolve, project owners seek innovative ways to showcase and promote their unique digital assets. One effective approach is hosting NFT raffles, which not only generate interest but also reward loyal supporters.

However, creating a raffle platform from scratch can be daunting, especially for those without extensive development experience. To address this challenge, we present a ready-to-use solution - a template for an NFT raffle platform built using React, IPFS, and smart contracts. In this article, we'll explore a real-world use case demonstrating the ease and efficiency of utilizing our template.

## What are NFT Raffles?

[NFT raffles](https://nftraffles.com/) are like digital lotteries where people have a chance to win unique digital assets known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). To take part, you usually buy tickets or enter the raffle, and winners get picked randomly. People use these raffles for different reasons, like promoting their NFT collections, raising funds, or engaging with their community. **Keep in mind that dealing with NFTs involves legal and financial stuff, so it's crucial to look into the rules and risks of any NFT raffle you join or organize.**

## The Motivation Behind Raffle Template

NFT raffles are an excellent way to distribute digital assets and engage with your audience, but they come with a set of challenges. Creating a secure, transparent, and user-friendly raffle platform from scratch can be a complex and time-consuming task. Fortunately, there's a solution that aims to make the process effortless: the Raffle Template.

## Raffle Template: Revolutionizing NFT Raffles

[Raffle Template](https://github.com/spheronFdn/raffle-template) is a simple NFT raffle application designed to streamline the process of hosting NFT raffles for various projects. This template provides a custom raffle smart contract and a user-friendly application to manage raffles. It allows the owner of the contract to put an NFT up for raffle, enables users to purchase raffle entries, and facilitates the random selection of a winner. The primary goal is to simplify the creation of NFT raffle platforms, making it easier for project owners to market their NFT projects.

The motivation behind this project is to eliminate the complexities associated with developing a raffle platform from scratch. By offering this template, we aim to empower anyone interested in starting a raffle for their NFT project. This template can serve as the foundation for creating more advanced raffle platforms, such as raffling multiple NFTs simultaneously or entire NFT collections.

## Raffle Template Usage

* **Ticket Price:** Customize the ticket price for the raffle.
    
* **Withdraw Funds:** After the raffle concludes, you can withdraw the funds collected from ticket sales.
    
* **Select Winner:** Use the "Select Winner" button to randomly choose a winner from the raffle entries. This entire process occurs on the blockchain, ensuring transparency in the raffle.
