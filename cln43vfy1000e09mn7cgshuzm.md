There has been growing interest in using the [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System) to host websites due to its potential for improved performance and reliability. While the technology is still developing, there have been notable advancements and successful implementations of IPFS-based websites. However, it's essential to be aware of the unique considerations and best practices associated with deploying an IPFS website to guarantee optimal functionality.

Before we get started, below are some helpful resources to learn more about the tools and guides by which you can successfully host your Web Apps on IPFS:

2. [**Storage SDK**](https://docs.spheron.network/sdk/storage-v2/) **-** The Storage SDK is a software development kit (SDK) that allows developers to upload and manage files on decentralized storage networks. It is equipped with multi-chain storage capabilities powered by Spheron and can be used to store files on IPFS, Filecoin, or Arweave. The Storage SDK is meant for Node.js-based environments.
    
3. [**Browser Upload SDK**](https://docs.spheron.network/sdk/browser/#upload) - The Browser SDK allows you to upload files directly from your browser to IPFS, Filecoin, or Arweave.
    

## To successfully host your website on IPFS, here are some top tips.

### **1\. Prepare your website for IPFS:** 

Before hosting your website on IPFS, you must prepare. Ensure that all the content for your website is contained in one build folder with an index.html file. If you're working with a JavaScript framework like Angular, ReactJS, or VueJS, you may need to tweak it to get it working with IPFS. **You can use the** [**Spheron Network Framework Guide**](https://docs.spheron.network/framework-guide/) **to deploy your static site successfully on IPFS.**

### **2.Make your website more accessible and available**

Transforming your IPFS website into an offline-first powerhouse is a journey that begins with harnessing the [**Service Worker API's**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) capabilities. This API allows you to intercept and cache network requests, ensuring your site's assets are readily available when users go offline or face slow connections. To take it a step further, embrace [**Progressive Web App (PWA) principles**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps), creating a manifest file and implementing service workers for an app-like experience with offline functionality. 

Smart caching of essential assets, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images, using strategies like cache-first or network-first, keeps your site snappy and responsive even in offline scenarios. Don't forget to provide an offline fallback to offer users meaningful content when requested assets aren't in the cache. Handling updates gracefully and rigorous testing with developer tools rounds out the process, ensuring your IPFS website delivers a seamless offline-first experience.

### **3.Choose a hosting option** 

There are different options for hosting your website on IPFS **use a cost-efficient service like** [**Spheron Network**](https://spheron.network/) **to host your website on IPFS, or choose other little bit costly options like Fleek or 4Everland.** These services provide gateways and domain systems that allow you to access your website through a human-readable domain name.

### **4\. Rather than using DNS, use ENS**  

[ENS (Ethereum Name Service)](https://ens.domains/) domains provide a decentralized naming system on the Ethereum blockchain, contrasting the traditional [DNS (Domain Name System)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/). 

They both serve the same fundamental purpose: utilizing domain names to map intricate addresses. However, the distinction lies in their approach. DNS translates domain names into IP addresses, while ENS employs .eth domain names to reference Ethereum addresses, IPFS file hashes, or Tor .onion addresses! **To know how to Connect Your Static Site with ENS Domain,** [**follow this guide**](https://blog.spheron.network/guide-to-connect-your-static-site-with-ens-domain)**.**

### **5.Use IPNS to resolve IPFS Hashes**  

IPFS is inherently immutable, generating a hash (CID) based on the content when a file is added. IPFS hashes are not very human-readable. However, there are scenarios where you need to update content addressed by IPFS regularly. Thankfully, [IPNS (InterPlanetary Name System)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipns/) offers a solution by allowing you to establish a mutable reference to IPFS CIDs. Think of IPNS names as dynamic links that can be modified over time while still ensuring the integrity of content addressing.

**For more detailed information, refer to the** [**Spheron IPNS section**](https://docs.spheron.network/sdk/storage-v2/#ipns-records) **for developers and users.** By employing IPNS, you can maintain flexibility and updatable references while preserving the robust content-addressing capabilities of IPFS.

### **6.Consider collaborative clusters**

Collaborative clusters in IPFS are groups of nodes that collaboratively pin all content added to the IPFS Cluster. This can help improve the availability and reliability of your website on IPFS. You can [learn more about collaborative clusters](https://ipfscluster.io/documentation/collaborative/setup/) and how to set up your own cluster.

### **7.Troubleshooting** 

There are some common problems that you may run into. It's important to understand these issues and how to solve them. Some troubleshooting tips include ensuring that your website's content is properly added to IPFS, checking your DNS records for any errors, and verifying that your website is accessible through the IPFS gateway.

**PaaS products like Spheron Network have Introduced their** [**new community forum**](https://community.spheron.network/) **to help developers so they can quickly find answers to their questions without sifting through endless messages from other sources.**
