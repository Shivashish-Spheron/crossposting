## **1\. Introduction and Welcome**

**Prakarsh**: Hey Nick, thank you so much for joining us today on Tech Fusion. It's always a pleasure to have such insightful discussions, and I think today's episode will be no different. We'll be diving deep into Assisterr, your journey, AI advancements, and more. But first, congratulations on the recent funding raise. Can you tell us a bit about Assisterr and how it all began?

**Nick**: Thank you, Prakarsh, and thanks for having me. Assisterr is an AI company that's focused on democratizing AI, but the story really began with my background in tech consulting, IoT, and machine learning. I’ve always been passionate about combining AI and Web3 technologies. In fact, that’s what led to the creation of Assisterr – a platform aimed at automating the support for developers working with different blockchain protocols.

## **2\. Early Days in AI and Web3**

**Prakarsh**: That’s fascinating! You mentioned that you’ve transitioned from consulting into the world of AI and Web3. What were some of the early challenges you encountered, especially with AI?

**Nick**: Well, in my previous ventures, we were automating sales and design functions for small to medium businesses, and that’s when I realized how challenging it can be to get AI systems to function well, especially in terms of accuracy and data access. This is a major problem, even today. Many companies face issues with keeping data updated and ensuring AI systems provide accurate results. That's one of the core areas Assisterr is targeting now.

---

## **3\. Bridging AI and Web3**

**Prakarsh**: Absolutely! When it comes to Web3, things get even more complex. Documentation is scattered across different platforms and protocols. How is Assisterr tackling that challenge?

**Nick**: Exactly, Prakarsh. Web3 has a serious documentation problem. Every protocol has its own way of structuring docs, and there’s no universal access to all that information. So, we decided to start by automating developer support. Our agents gather information from protocols like Solana and Ethereum, and they provide instant support to developers. It not only saves time but helps create a more seamless onboarding experience for builders.

---

## **4\. Developer-Centric Focus**

**Prakarsh**: That’s amazing! I’ve seen how challenging developer onboarding can be. It’s interesting how you’ve made AI specifically for devs. Can you tell us more about this feature and how it’s revolutionizing developer support?

**Nick**: Sure! Developers, especially in Web3, spend hours answering the same set of questions over and over. We’re saving them from that repetitive work. Our agents use a pre-trained dataset to handle 80-90% of developer questions, and for the rare cases where the agent can’t help, we gather insights to improve documentation and support.

---

## **5\. The Power of Small Language Models**

**Prakarsh**: That makes a huge difference in productivity. Another aspect of Assisterr that caught my eye is the idea of “small language models.” Can you explain why you’ve focused on this concept?

**Nick**: Yes, we believe that small, specialized language models are the future. Large models like OpenAI’s GPT are great, but they come with high costs and inefficiencies. Small language models can be more efficient and accurate, especially when fine-tuned for specific use cases like developer support. We’re already seeing the benefits with over 400,000 registered users and thousands of models being deployed by our community.

---

## **6\. AI Lab: Democratizing Model Creation**

**Prakarsh**: Speaking of scale, I heard you’re launching an AI Lab soon. What’s the goal there?

**Nick**: AI Lab is our way of enabling anyone to create and launch their own AI models. Whether you're a developer, a marketer, or just someone with a lot of data, you can use our platform to build your own AI agent. We’re excited about the potential for creators across different industries to take advantage of this infrastructure.

---

## **7\. Collaborating with Spheron on Decentralized Compute**

**Prakarsh**: That’s something Spheron could collaborate on as well. I think we’ve had discussions about integrating your models with decentralized compute through Spheron. How do you see that evolving?

**Nick**: Definitely. We’re currently using Google Cloud and AWS for compute, but we’re open to transitioning to decentralized solutions like Spheron as we grow. Once we hit a clear product-market fit and understand our computing needs better, we’ll make business decisions based on cost and efficiency, and I believe decentralized compute will play a huge role.

---

## **8\. Tokenizing Models and Future Roadmap**

**Prakarsh**: You’re working on tokenizing models as well, right? Could you explain how that fits into Assisterr’s roadmap?

**Nick**: Exactly. We're creating a system where community members can create, manage, and monetize AI models. Think of it like an app store but for AI. Each model has a treasury, and users can contribute to it, manage it, and benefit from its success. Our goal is to build a participatory economy around AI.

---

## **9\. The Future of AI: Decentralized and Specialized**

**Prakarsh**: That’s a great vision. Now, looking ahead, where do you see AI and decentralized compute heading in the next decade?

**Nick**: I think the future of AI is going to be highly decentralized. We won’t have one giant, all-powerful AI. Instead, we’ll see thousands of small, specialized models working together, each designed to handle specific tasks. Everyone will have the tools to build their own AI agents, automating their work and improving their lives. The key will be orchestrating this network of models effectively.

---

## **10\. Conclusion and Final Thoughts**

**Prakarsh**: That’s an exciting future to imagine! Nick, thank you so much for sharing your insights today. I think our listeners will have a lot to think about after this episode. Any final thoughts?

**Nick**: Just that we’re on the cusp of something huge. AI is becoming more accessible, and I believe that soon, anyone will be able to create their own AI solutions. It’s all about empowering people to use technology to solve real problems.

**Prakarsh**: Absolutely. It’s been a pleasure having you on the show, and I can’t wait to see how Assisterr evolves. Thanks again, Nick!

**Nick**: Thank you, Prakarsh. Looking forward to our future collaborations!
