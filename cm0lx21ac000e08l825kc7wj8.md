## **Core Differences Between GeForce RTX 3070 and H100 PCIe**

The primary difference between the RTX 3070 and H100 PCIe is their architecture. The RTX 3070’s Ampere architecture is optimized for gaming, with dedicated ray-tracing cores and DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) technology that enhances gaming visuals. In contrast, the H100's Hopper architecture focuses on AI acceleration, offering unmatched Tensor core performance and memory bandwidth, which are essential for AI model training.

* **CUDA and Tensor Cores**: The RTX 3070 comes with 5888 CUDA cores and 184 Tensor cores, while the H100 boasts tens of thousands of CUDA cores with a much higher number of Tensor cores, optimized specifically for deep learning tasks.
    
* **Memory Bandwidth**: The RTX 3070 offers 448 GB/s of bandwidth, whereas the H100 PCIe exceeds this significantly, providing over 2 TB/s, allowing it to handle massive data loads efficiently.
    

## **Performance in Gaming**

When it comes to gaming, the RTX 3070 excels. With real-time ray tracing and DLSS capabilities, it delivers smooth frame rates at high resolutions, even in the most demanding games. Benchmarks often show the RTX 3070 achieving over 60 FPS in 1440p and 4K settings in games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. Its power efficiency and cooling capabilities also ensure a consistent gaming experience without significant throttling.

The H100 PCIe is not designed for gaming, but it**s powerful computational cores allow it to run games at basic setting**s. However, without optimizations like ray tracing and DLSS, the gaming experience falls short compared to the RTX 3070. Its architecture prioritizes AI computations over graphical fidelity, making it an impractical choice for gamers.

## **AI and Machine Learning Performance**

While the RTX 3070 is primarily a gaming GPU, it still packs some serious AI capabilities thanks to its Tensor cores.
