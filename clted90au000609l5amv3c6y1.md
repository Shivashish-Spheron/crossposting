Centralized cloud computing services typically impose fees on users, which can be burdensome for smaller businesses. For instance, [Amazon's AWS charges $23](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/) monthly for cloud data center storage. Although these providers claim to handle data ethically, they still can analyze user data for service improvement and targeted advertising, which many find invasive. Moreover, their centralized server model increases the risk of data breaches.

In contrast, decentralized cloud computing, powered by blockchain technology, is gaining traction among businesses. It operates on a peer-to-peer network where users can access cloud services or offer resources like computing power and storage. The infrastructure of decentralized cloud computing manages the hosting and deployment of these services.

For example, Ethernity Cloud, developed on the Ethereum platform, enables the execution of decentralized applications and smart contracts, eliminating the need for a central authority. This is achieved through the use of smart contracts.

Decentralized cloud data storage is particularly prominent in this landscape, with providers like Spheron Network offering enhanced security compared to traditional server-client models. As the market expands, more providers, such as [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/), are emerging with innovative approaches to capture their cloud storage market share.

Now, let's delve into the workings and features of a decentralized cloud network.

## Cloud computing

Cloud computing has become popular lately. It's a way of accessing and using computer resources like servers and storage over the internet without needing to own or manage them yourself. This lets you quickly get what you need and return it when you're done, with little hassle.

Cloud computing has a few important parts:

1. **Essential Characteristics**: This includes things like being able to get what you need whenever you want (on-demand self-service), being able to access it from anywhere (broad network access), pooling resources together to make them more efficient, being able to quickly scale up or down as needed (rapid elasticity), and being able to track and measure what you use (measured service).
    
2. **Service Models**: There are different ways you can use cloud computing. You can use software that's already set up and ready to go (Software as a Service - SaaS), you can use a platform that lets you build your own software without worrying about the underlying infrastructure (Platform as a Service - PaaS), or you can use the basic building blocks like servers and storage (Infrastructure as a Service - IaaS).
    
3. **Deployment Models**: This is about where the cloud is located and who can use it. It could be private, just for one organization, or public, where anyone can use it. There are also hybrid options that combine different types of clouds and community clouds that a specific group of users shares.
    

The big companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are the main players in the cloud industry. They all use similar setups where your data is stored on their servers, and you access it over the internet. But relying on these centralized systems has some problems:

* They can be prone to outages, like when Google services went down in 2020, leaving lots of people unable to access things like YouTube or Gmail.
    
* They might not always perform as well as they could, especially if the servers are far away from where you are.
    
* They can be expensive to maintain and keep secure.
    
* There are worries about privacy and security, especially if the servers get hacked.
    

One way to deal with these issues is to decentralize the cloud using artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technologies. This means spreading things out more, so there's less risk of everything going down simultaneously. It also adds extra layers of security and makes it harder for anyone to tamper with your data.

## Cloud Decentralization

Decentralization means not relying on one main server or data center. Instead, decision-making is spread out among all the connected devices. In a decentralized cloud, computing tasks are moved closer to where needed, like on your phone or computer.

In an ideal decentralized cloud setup, every device on the network can act like its own mini-server. These devices can handle sharing files, streaming videos, and working together without a big central server.

## What should be the Objectives of Decentralized Cloud Computing?

A decentralized cloud computing solution should aim to achieve several key objectives:

1. **Ensure No Single Entity Control:** The network should be decentralized, meaning no single entity has absolute control over the entire platform. This prevents monopolies and ensures fair competition.
    
2. **Competitive Marketplace:** The decentralized nature of the network should foster competition among multiple service providers. This competition will lead to better quality services, particularly in areas like data storage.
    
3. **Data Integrity and Privacy:** Users should have complete control over their data, including the ability to delete it and ensure its integrity when retrieved from the service provider. Additionally, only the users should have access to their data, ensuring privacy.
    
4. **Redundancy and Reliability:** The system should incorporate redundancy measures to ensure data safety and prevent loss or corruption. This reliability is crucial for maintaining trust in the service.
    
5. **Performance:** The service should offer reliable performance, allowing users to access their cloud resources promptly whenever needed.
    
6. **Cost-Effectiveness:** The service should be economically viable for customers, avoiding excessive fees commonly seen in centralized cloud services.
    
7. **Incentives for Participation:** Service providers and users should be incentivized to participate in the network, whether through earning fees for resources or receiving quality services at reasonable costs.
    

In a decentralized cloud storage system, individuals with excess resources, such as storage space or computing power, can rent these resources for a fee. Users seeking these resources on the global network will then pay for the services they utilize.

By decentralizing the network, the system eliminates single points of failure, enhancing data security and safety. Transparent mechanisms ensure that users pay fees and reward quality service providers while holding subpar providers accountable for their performance.

Consider a practical example of a decentralized cloud storage service operating within this framework.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, decentralized computing is a rapidly evolving field with great promise for transforming various industries and sectors. By empowering users with control over their data and fostering transparency, security, and efficiency, decentralized applications (dApps) are poised to revolutionize how we interact and conduct business. From finance and supply chain management to healthcare, education, social media, and gaming, the potential use cases for dApps are vast and diverse.

As the world becomes increasingly digital, it is essential to ensure that technology serves the needs of individuals and society rather than concentrating power in the hands of a select few. Decentralized computing offers a powerful toolkit for achieving this goal, enabling the creation of open, inclusive systems that promote collaboration, innovation, and user autonomy.

While there are challenges to overcome in developing and implementing dApps, the benefits of decentralization are undeniable. As the next generation of technologists, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders, we must harness the power of decentralized computing to build a better future for all.
