# Introduction

When creating a dApp, we usually use a blockchain like [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum). Imagine you are building a decentralized social media platform on Ethereum. Users can share images, videos, and text. But how will you store all this content in a decentralized way? Usually, files are kept on a central server like AWS, GCP, or Azure, but that can be costly and inefficient.

To solve this, we use [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/), a decentralized and distributed protocol to store and share files in a peer-to-peer network. Instead of relying on one server, IPFS spreads files across many computers connected to the network. This makes files more available, secure, and reliable.

In this blog post, we'll explore how you can harness the power of IPFS with [Spheron's](https://spheron.network/) Browser Upload SDK to store data in a decentralized, secure, and cost-effective manner. 

## Why Use Spheron's Browser Upload SDK?

Spheron's Browser Upload SDK is a tool that makes it easy for developers to upload files directly from a web browser to services like IPFS, Filecoin, or Arweave. It handles all the complexities of interacting with the IPFS network, so you can focus on building your application without worrying about the details. The SDK also offers features like encryption, access control, and streaming, making it a powerful tool for creating modern web applications.

One of the main advantages of using browser upload SDK is that you can avoid writing complex code for file uploading, such as multi-chunking and parallelization. Another advantage is that it takes care of storage scalability and redundancy, so you don't have to worry about managing lots of server space or developing a complicated mechanism to load balancing on your server instances. 

## **Prerequisites**

Before we begin, make sure you do the following:

* Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your machine.
    
* Create a Spheron account from [here](https://app.spheron.network/#/signup).
    
* Before creating an access token for authentication, new users need to sync their GitHub or GitLab account to give Spheron access. 
    

## **Step 1: Creating an Access Token**

To generate and manage Access Tokens for your Spheron dashboard app, follow these steps:

1. Go to your profile icon in your Spheron dashboard app and click on it.
    
2. Click on settings from the image above to your settings page and navigate to the Tokens in your Account Settings.
    
3. Click Create to open a new Access Token.
    
4. Enter a descriptive name, choose the scope from the list of Organizations in the drop-down menu, select an expiration date for the token, and click create token.
    

By following these steps, you'll have successfully created an access token. Creating an access token allows you to authenticate and authorize your applications to interact with the Spheron API and utilize its features and functionalities. The scope ensures that only your specified Organization can use an Access Token. Once you've created an Access Token, securely store the value, as it will not be shown again.

**Note:** When creating the access token, choosing the "web app" type in the dashboard is recommended. This token can be used with various Spheron SDKs, such as the Storage SDK and the Compute SDK.

## **Step 2: Installing the Spheron Browser SDK**

To begin, You will need to install the Spheron Browser SDK. If you're working with npm, use the following command in your terminal to install the SDK:

```javascript
npm i @spheron/browser-upload
```

For yarn, run the following command instead:

```javascript
yarn add @spheron/browser-upload
```

To use the Browser SDK for file uploads, you'll need a web server to provide a `uploadToken` for data upload and a web app with the `@spheron/browser-upload` module to enable direct browser-based file uploads.

## **Step 3: Setting Up the Server**

You need to set up an express server with an endpoint `GET: /initiate-upload` that will be used by the client project to get the `uploadToken` and to use it to upload data. In the example, we have created an `/initiate-upload` endpoint. The `createSingleUploadToken` method from the `@spheron/storage` package generates the `uploadToken`. All the logic is in `index.js`. 

To start the project:

1. Execute `npm install`
    
2. Create a `.env` file in the root and SPHERON\_TOKEN variable with the value of your Spheron API Token.
    
    **Note:** You must also create an Access Token to create the Spheron client. Make sure to choose the web app type in the Spheron dashboard while generating the Access Token.
    
3. Execute `npm start`
    

```javascript
// Import the necessary modules from the @spheron/browser-upload package
import { SpheronClient, ProtocolEnum } from "@spheron/storage";
 
// ...
 
// Set up an endpoint on the server to fetch the uploadToken
app.get("/initiate-upload", async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const bucketName = "example-browser-upload";
    const protocol = ProtocolEnum.IPFS; // desired protocol
    const token = process.env.SPHERON_TOKEN; 
 
    // Create a new SpheronClient instance with the access token
    const client = new SpheronClient({ token });
 
    // Generate the uploadToken using createSingleUploadToken method
    const { uploadToken } = await client.createSingleUploadToken({
      name: bucketName,
      protocol,
    });
 
    // Respond with the uploadToken in JSON format
    res.status(200).json({
      uploadToken,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error); // Handle any errors that may occur
    next(error);
  }
});
```

## **Step 4: Web App Setup**

You must create a React web app to upload files directly from the browser using a package called `@spheron/browser-upload`. The app will first ask the server (Backend Service) for `uploadToken` to enable secure file uploads. Once it receives the token from the server, it will upload the files. For more reference, check out this [**example**](https://github.com/spheronFdn/sdk/blob/main/examples/browser-upload/client/src/Upload.tsx)**.**

To start the project, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm install` in your project directory to install the necessary dependencies.
    
2. Then, run `npm start` to start the web app.
    

The browser upload provides three methods:

### **1\. Upload your files**

To upload files from the browser, you must first request the `uploadToken` from the server. Then, you can use the upload method from `@spheron/browser-upload` to upload your files.

```javascript
// Import the necessary modules from @spheron/browser-upload package
import { upload } from "@spheron/browser-upload";
 
// ...
 
// Fetch the temporary access token from the server using the /initiate-upload endpoint
const response = await fetch(`<BACKEND_URL>/initiate-upload`);
const resJson = await response.json();
const token = resJson.uploadToken;
 
let currentlyUploaded = 0; // Initialize a variable to keep track of the uploaded size
 
// Use the upload method to upload files from the browser to IPFS
const { uploadId, bucketId, protocolLink, dynamicLinks } = await upload(files, {
  token, // Pass the uploadToken for authorization
  onChunkUploaded: (uploadedSize, totalSize) => {
    currentlyUploaded += uploadedSize;
    console.log(`Uploaded ${currentlyUploaded} of ${totalSize} Bytes.`);
  },
});
```

### **2\. Encrypt & Upload your Files** 

To encrypt and upload data to IPFS, you can use the `encryptUpload` function. It requires an instance of `LitNodeClient` that is already connected.  Additionally, you need to provide the necessary parameters like `authSig`, `accessControlConditions`, `chain`, `filePath`, and `litNodeClient`.

```javascript
const { uploadId, bucketId, protocolLink, dynamicLinks } = await spheron.encryptUpload({
  authSig, // (optional) The authSig of the user
  accessControlConditions, // (optional) The access control conditions for the signed token
  chain, // The chain name of the chain where the contract is deployed
  filePath, // (optional) The path of the file to encrypt and upload
  litNodeClient: client,
  configuration: {
    name: bucketName, // The name of the bucket on which you are uploading the data
  },
});
```

### **3\. Decrypt your Uploaded Files**

To decrypt the data of a previously encrypted upload, you can use the `decryptUpload function`. Like the `encryptUpload` function, it also requires an instance of `LitNodeClient` that is already connected with the `authSig` and the `IpfsCid` of the uploaded data.

```javascript
const decryptedData: Uint8Array = spheron.decryptUpload({
  authSig, // (optional) The authSig of the user
  ipfsCid, // The IPFS cid of the previously encrypted & uploaded data
  litNodeClient, // An instance of LitNodeClient that is already connected
});
```

After you start the client and server, you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and upload data to the specified protocol.

## **Step 5: Handling the Response**

Upon successfully uploading the file, the upload function will provide a response containing useful information. For example, the response includes `uploadId`, `bucketId`, `protocolLink`, `dynamicLinks`, and `cid`. These details can be utilized for future retrieval or management of the uploaded file.

**Response**

```javascript
interface UploadRes {
  uploadId: string;
  bucketId: string;
  protocolLink: string;
  dynamicLinks: Domain[];
  cid: string;
}
```

## **Step 6: Accessing the Uploaded Data**

The `protocolLink` property of the object returned by the upload function is a URL that can be used to access the uploaded file. The protocol link is a unique identifier for the upload, and it can be used to access the file from any IPFS node.

For example, the following code will print the protocol link of the uploaded file

```javascript
console.log(upload.protocolLink);
```
