AI inference is a crucial phase where a trained AI model is tested using live data to make predictions or perform tasks. It represents the model's ability to apply what it learned during training to real-world situations. Tasks could include identifying email spam, transcribing conversations, or summarizing reports. The effectiveness of an AI model during inference depends on how well it utilizes its training to produce accurate and useful results.

This involves analyzing real-time data by comparing a user's input with the information stored in its parameters, known as weights, from the training phase. The model's response will vary based on the specific task, whether filtering spam, converting speech to text, or extracting key points from documents. In essence, training and inference in AI mirror human learning and application of knowledge, using past experiences to interpret new data.

### Enhancing AI Inference with GPUs

The introduction of NVIDIA's new hardware at [GTC 2024](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/) showcased significant advancements in AI inference acceleration through GPUs. These developments are particularly relevant for running sophisticated AI models like [OpenAI's GPT-4](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/), where high computational power is essential for applications ranging from customer service chatbots to quality control in manufacturing.

[**NVIDIA's H100 GPUs**](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/data-center/h100/)**, based on the Hopper architecture, illustrate these advancements. Integrated into the** [**NVIDIA DGX H100**](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/data-center/dgx-h100/) **platform, they provide a massive 32 petaFLOPS computing performance. This platform is also available in the cloud via partners like Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon Web Services, signaling a shift towards more scalable and flexible AI computing resources. NVIDIA has introduced specialized hardware like the NVIDIA L4, a low-profile accelerator for AI and graphics capable of running models and encoding video up to 120 times faster than CPU-based platforms. The NVIDIA L40 is designed for AI-powered image generation, showcasing the varied applications of these new GPUs. The NVIDIA H100 NVL is a specialized chip for real-time large language model (LLM) inference, capable of making inferences up to 12 times faster than older models.**

### Transforming AI Inference: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090

Advancements in GPU technology are revolutionizing [AI inference](https://www.oracle.com/in/artificial-intelligence/ai-inference/), making it faster, more efficient, and more accessible for various applications, from the edge to the cloud. Integrating these advancements with [Spheron](https://www.spheron.network/) blockchain technology for decentralized GPU computing further enhances the AI inference landscape. Spheron leverages blockchain to create a distributed network of GPU resources, allowing open access to high-powered computing for AI.

### The High Cost of AI Inference for Businesses and Developers

The high costs associated with AI inference are a significant concern, projected to rise further due to the ongoing GPU shortage. GPUs are essential for efficient AI inference, but demand exceeds supply, driving costs. As AI models become more sophisticated and require more processing power, the reliance on GPUs increases, exacerbating the shortage. NVIDIAâ€™s new hardware generation, designed specifically for AI inference tasks, highlights the growing demand for powerful GPUs. These GPUs are crucial for powering advanced AI models, necessitating significant investment in computational resources.

For businesses and developers, this means a higher initial investment in GPUs and increased operational costs due to electricity, data storage, and management expenses. The scarcity of GPUs forces businesses to compete for limited resources, often at premium prices. As AI advances and finds applications in more sectors, the demand for GPUs is expected to grow, potentially leading to even higher costs and challenging the scalability of AI projects.
