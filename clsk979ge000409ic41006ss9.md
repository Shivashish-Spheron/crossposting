As part of our commitment to providing you with the best possible service, we have scheduled a maintenance window on **February 21st from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM UTC**. This period of downtime is planned to allow us to implement significant enhancements to our platform, ensuring a smoother, more efficient experience for all our users.

### **What to Expect**

During the maintenance window, compute deployments will be temporarily unavailable. However, it's important to note that your nodes will be running as usual, and there is no downtime expected on any instance during the maintenance. We understand the impact this may have on your operations and have carefully chosen this time to minimize the disruption to your activities.

### **Why This Maintenance is Important**

The upgrades we are implementing are crucial for:

* **Enhancing Performance:** Making our platform faster and more reliable.
    
* **Adding New Features:** Introducing a new feature that will allow users to create instances with multiple services and enable us to build templates that have multiple services to run together. This update is designed to provide you with more flexibility and efficiency in managing your deployments.
    

### **Stay Informed**

We will keep you updated on our progress throughout the maintenance window.
