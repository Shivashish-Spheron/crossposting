Fundamental analysis of crypto is crucial for investors to make informed decisions based on a cryptocurrency's intrinsic value and potential. Unlike traditional financial markets, the crypto market is highly volatile and influenced by various speculative factors. Fundamental analysis provides a broader perspective, allowing investors to distinguish between viable projects and those with weak fundamentals.

## Deciphering **the fundamental analysis**

The fundamental analysis approach is key for prudent investment in the crypto universe. At the basic level, it involves evaluating the intrinsic value of crypto by examining various factors outside its price movements. This includes the inherent technology backing the project, the team behind the project, the market for the project, the regulatory environment, and so on.

One should assess the supply and demand dynamics of the broader crypto project and understand the impact of other economic factors, such as inflationary pressures, and the impact of crypto-related events, such as the Bitcoin halving events. A solid understanding is crucial for anticipating future trends. One should also understand the crypto project's practical applications and use cases and focus on those with tangible capabilities and long-term real-world applications.
