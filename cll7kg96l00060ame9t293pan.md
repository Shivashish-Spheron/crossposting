## Spheron Network Vs. Fleek

Spheron Network is considered a superior choice compared to Fleek for building, hosting, and powering web apps and infrastructure on the decentralized web. One of the key advantages of Spheron Network is its [cost-effective pricing](https://spheron.network/pricing/) plans, which provide businesses with more bandwidth, storage, build execution time, better IPFS storage, Filecoin, and Arweave support. This makes Spheron a more attractive option as it offers better value for money.

On the other hand, Fleek falls short in comparison to Spheron Network. It lacks the same level of support as Spheron, and its pricing [plans](https://fleek.co/pricing/) are higher while offering fewer features. Fleek also lacks transparency when it comes to pricing and the features included in their different plans. Users considering upgrading plans may find it challenging to determine exactly what features they will receive. Plan information is only available on Fleek's billing page, making it challenging for users to make informed decisions about their subscription options.

Furthermore, Fleek is currently undergoing a platform change from [fleek.co](http://fleek.co) to [fleek.xyz](http://fleek.xyz). This transition may result in increased prices on the new platform and could potentially cause issues for users during the migration process. Users may experience disruptions in their web-based experiences, including downtime, data lock-in, performance issues, migrating difficulties, and increased bandwidth transfer costs.
