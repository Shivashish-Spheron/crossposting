The evolution of GPU cloud servers into mainstream technology can be traced back almost 60 years. In [1968, computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics#:~:text=In%201968%2C%20Dave,University%20of%20Utah.) were in their infancy, and researchers were already exploring the idea of speeding up graphics cards. Today, GPUs are ideally suited for deep learning tasks thanks to their ability to perform many floating-point operations per second (FLOPS). This allows them to train deep neural networks quickly and accurately.

Furthermore, GPU cloud servers can be combined to form powerful cloud servers capable of handling large-scale computing tasks. Knowing the story of the GPU's evolution is critical because it exemplifies how technology advancements can lead to new and unexpected applications. GPUs are now at the forefront of AI, having come a long way from their origins as graphics cards in personal computers. However, their evolution was not linear; it was not the evolution of processors that propelled this technology forward.

## How was the GPU Developed?

During the [1980s, researchers actively explored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing#:~:text=Advances%20in%20instruction%2Dlevel%20parallelism,performance%20(IPC%20%3D%201).) and experimented with new ways to make computer graphics faster and more efficient by harnessing the power of parallel computer architecture. This approach involved combining several smaller computers with large memory banks and high-speed processing to create one supercomputer. Although the first generation of graphics cards operated in a parallel fashion, it was limited to just within the graphics card, as opposed to what would come next.

The supercomputer approach was used to build extremely powerful machines usually reserved for government agencies and large corporations. These machines were used in critical fields like weather forecasting and scientific research. However, it was deemed too expensive and complex for the average person to use, so computer designers sought to find a way to put the parallel supercomputer architecture into a smaller, less expensive, and less powerful computer that a wider range of people could use.

## How is Today’s GPU Different from Previous Generations?

Today's graphics card is an undeniable powerhouse, built upon a single chip that packs in hundreds (or even thousands) of GPUs. These GPUs are designed to execute numerous programmed instructions simultaneously, making them an unparalleled choice for easily handling complex computer graphics and general-purpose tasks.

They are the driving force behind many technological advancements and are essential in unlocking innovation in various fields. As GPUs evolve, they have transformed from exclusively designed for the gaming industry to becoming crucial in various computational applications.

As pioneers in the field, companies like Nvidia and AMD have propelled the evolution of GPUs since the 1990s. With significant milestones like the introduction of programmable shaders and CUDA, GPUs can now perform general-purpose computations, extending their use beyond graphics rendering. This adaptability has opened new avenues for GPUs, making them indispensable in scientific simulations, financial modeling, and Artificial Intelligence.

## What is a General-Purpose GPU?

GPUs are commonly referred to as general-purpose GPUs (GPGPUs), meaning they are not only used for graphical tasks. GPGPU is a computer architecture that performs non-graphical computations using the graphics processing unit. This architecture is highly parallel and optimized for graphics processing and visualization. Since GPUs are designed to handle many simple computations simultaneously, they are incredibly adept at performing the kind of parallel computation some scientific applications require.

The term "general purpose" in the GPGPU definition is derived from the OpenCL programming language. This language provides a standardized way for programmers to write programs that can run on different types of parallel computers. Programmers often use OpenCL to write programs that can run on GPUs.

## Why Are GPUs So Effective for AI and ML Applications?

GPUs are undeniably exceptional at handling numerous simple computations simultaneously. This makes them the most suitable tool for performing many computations required when training a neural network or carrying out a [convolutional neural network (CNN) analysis.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-convolution-neural-network/)

Establishing the definitions of the fundamental concepts that form the basis of GPU cloud servers is crucial to avoid any ambiguity. 

Machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are concepts. Machine learning refers to an automated system's ability to identify data patterns without human intervention. This ability enables robots and other devices to interact with their environment, sense their surroundings, and make decisions autonomously, just like humans.

On the other hand, artificial intelligence is concerned with developing intelligent machines using computer software systems that exhibit intelligent behavior or decision-making capabilities by completing complex tasks. CNN and other algorithms rely heavily on parallel computation to train quickly and efficiently. GPUs' capacity to do more work simultaneously makes them the go-to option, especially for training deep neural networks.

## **GPUs are increasingly being used for neural network applications**

The unparalleled parallel processing power of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) is evident in their transition from gaming to neural networks and deep learning. Unlike Central Processing Units that excel in sequential processing, GPUs are designed with thousands of smaller, more efficient cores capable of handling multiple tasks simultaneously. This architectural superiority makes GPUs particularly well suited for the matrix operations and calculations essential in training neural networks.

Deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and [Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/recurrent-neural-networks), heavily rely on GPUs' parallel computation capabilities. The ability to process large volumes of data simultaneously accelerates the training of these models, reducing the time required from weeks to days or even hours. This acceleration has been pivotal in the advancements of AI, enabling the creation of more complex and sophisticated models capable of tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicle navigation.

The adoption of GPUs in deep learning has spurred significant research and development efforts, leading to the creation of specialized GPUs tailored for AI workloads. These AI-optimized GPUs feature enhanced memory bandwidth, higher compute density, and advanced cooling solutions, catering to the demanding requirements of deep learning applications.

## How has GPU Become the brain that drives AI and ML?

GPU cloud servers are the ultimate solution for handling massive amounts of data, making them the ideal choice for working with big data sets. The importance of GPUs in AI and ML cannot be overstated, as numerous companies are now developing their custom GPUs to optimize their hardware for specific workloads and gain competitive advantages.

The future of AI and ML is exciting, and GPUs are the driving force behind it. They are the key to unlocking the power of these technologies and will continue to be essential for driving innovation in these fields. The rapid development of GPUs can be attributed to a critical moment in the late 1990s when the graphics card industry made parallel computer architecture a standard product line feature.

This was a game-changer for the graphics card industry, as including the parallel GPU as an industry standard shifted the focus from entertainment to parallel processing. GPUs are now widely adopted by the scientific community, as parallel processors are exceptionally efficient at performing computations used in scientific research. Including GPUs in the graphics card industry allowed their use in AI research.

## Who Develops GPUs Today?

Graphics cards are essential in various industries, powering computations and facilitating visualizations. According to a [recent report by Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/735904/worldwide-x86-intel-amd-market-share/), Intel dominated the PC GPU market share with a whopping 64% for Q2 of 2024. GPU cloud servers have become integral to every niche business from weather forecasting to stock analysis. The demand for GPUs to perform complex computations has skyrocketed, leading to an unprecedented boom in GPU computing and a surge in the number of companies that build GPUs.
