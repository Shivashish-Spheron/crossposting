In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the demand for GPU resources is skyrocketing – particularly given the ongoing surge in AI and machine learning applications. Traditional centralized GPU markets are struggling to keep pace with this demand, leading to increased costs and limited access.

To address these growing resource needs, Spheron has created a groundbreaking global compute network that ensures the efficient, cost-effective, and equitable distribution of GPU resources. Now, anyone can earn passive returns by lending their excess GPU power to Spheron Network – and become a vital part of the decentralized AI revolution!

Spheron’s decentralized market connects you to a worldwide user base that's ready to utilize providers’ excess compute power, no matter where they are. Let’s break down how it works.

## Spheron’s Decentralized Compute Network

At the heart of Spheron's protocol lies the Decentralized Compute Network (DCN), a distributed framework where independent providers supply GPU and compute resources. This network ensures resilience, scalability, and accessibility, catering to the diverse needs of AI and ML projects. Central to the DCN is the Matchmaking Engine, which is designed to efficiently connect GPU users with providers.

## Matchmaking Engine: Enabling Efficient, Automated Resource Allocation

Spheron's Matchmaking Engine is tasked with the essential role of orchestrating the dynamic allocation of GPU resources between deployment requests and provider nodes. This mechanism leverages the Actively Validated Services (AVS) framework from EigenLayer, which incorporates a sophisticated consensus algorithm to match deployment requests with the most suitable providers.

How it Works:

1. **Provider Registration:** Providers begin by registering their compute specs, region, tier, and other relevant details on the Provider Registry.
    
2. **Provider Lookup and Bidding**: When a user initiates a deployment request, the matchmaking engine broadcasts a *PROVIDER\_LOOKUP* event. Providers that meet the deployment criteria submit their bids, detailing their capacity and pricing.
    
3. **Consensus-Based Matching**: The matchmaking algorithm evaluates these bids based on predefined parameters, such as geographic proximity, price, uptime, and reputation. Once a quorum is reached, the optimal provider is selected, and the matched order is updated in the Task Manager contract.
    
4. **Lease Creation and Deployment**: Following the provider selection, the Deployment Order contract establishes a lease with the provider, initiating the deployment process. The provider then configures and activates the server, with all relevant deployment details made available to the user.
    
5. **Payment and Settlement**: Once a user chooses a provider to deploy their workloads, all pertinent details are shared on-chain, marking the beginning of payment settlement based on the pricing set by the provider.
    

In addition to the above steps, Provider Nodes are also responsible for maintaining their node activity and chain state synchronization. Specific responsibilities include:

* **Deployment Management**: Provider Nodes are responsible for the continuous management of deployments, including the initiation (*CREATE\_LEASE*), update (*UPDATE\_LEASE*), and termination (*CLOSE\_LEASE*) of services. Each action is meticulously recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and traceability.
    
* **Synchronization and Reliability**: To maintain operational alignment with the network, Provider Nodes run RPC / Sequencer nodes to synchronize with the latest chain state. This synchronization is critical for participating in the bidding process and for ensuring the timely and successful execution of deployments.
    

Together, the above steps ensure the continual exchange of available GPU resources with end users within a seamless, low-cost environment.
