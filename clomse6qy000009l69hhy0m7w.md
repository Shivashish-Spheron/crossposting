The internet is changing rapidly, and Web 3.0 (Web3) is seen as the potential future of the internet. It has the potential to transform how the internet functions and what it requires for hosting. Unlike Web2, which is currently dominated by big companies that control access to services in exchange for personal data, Web3 is designed to decentralize value and data. This means that anyone on the network can use services without needing permission, and access cannot be blocked or denied. To achieve this, Web3 applications run on blockchains, which are distributed ledgers that establish trust without the need for a third party.
