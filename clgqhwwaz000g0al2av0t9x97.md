Drupal is a popular open-source content management system (CMS) that can be used to build websites and web applications. It is known for its flexibility, scalability, and extensibility. If you want to build a Drupal website with [Spheron Compute Marketplace](https://docs.spheron.network/marketplace-guide/) and use a MySQL database, you have come to the right place. This blog post will guide you through setting up a Drupal website on Spheron and connecting it to a MySQL database.

## What is Spheron?

[Spheron](https://spheron.network/) is a Web3 cloud infrastructure platform that allows developers to manage web3 cloud infra quickly and easily. It is designed to simplify the process of building, deploying, and scaling applications, making it an ideal choice for Drupal websites.

You can follow these steps to launch your own Drupal application:

### Step 1: Create a Spheron Account

The first step in building a Drupal website with Spheron is to create a Spheron Account. Sign up with Github, Gitlab, or Bitbucket on the Spheron platform.

### Step 2: Choose a Drupal App from Spheron Compute Marketplace

Once you have a Spheron account, you can go to compute dashboard and browse the marketplace to find a Drupal app. You can do this by navigating to the "Marketplace App" section of the Spheron dashboard and searching for "Drupal." From there, you can select a compute plan that meets your needs and click the "Deploy" button to get started.

### Step 3: Wait for the Drupal instance to provision

Next, you must wait for the Drupal instance to provision. Once the instance is provisioned, Spheron will share a link where you can start setting up your Drupal website's initial settings. When you are required to attach a database, please go to the next step.

### Step 4: Set Up a MySQL Database

The next step is to set up a MySQL database for your Drupal website. You can do this by creating a new MySQL database separately. You can do this within Spheron, but since Spheron doesnâ€™t support persistent storage, we recommend using another platform to launch your MySQL database.

### Step 5: Connect Drupal to the MySQL Database

Once your MySQL database is set up, you must connect Drupal to the database. This can be done by configuring the database settings in the Drupal configuration file. You must provide the database name, host, port, username, and password, which can all be found in your MySQL dashboard settings.

### Step 6: Test Your Drupal Website

With everything set up and connected, you can now test your Drupal website to ensure everything works as expected. You should be able to access your site and perform basic functions, such as creating and editing content.

## Conclusion

Building a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) website with Spheron Compute and using an externally deployed MySQL for the database is a great way to quickly and easily deploy a robust, scalable website. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you should get your Drupal website up and running in no time.
