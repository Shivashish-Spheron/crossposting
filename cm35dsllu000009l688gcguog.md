OpenAI recently launched two new models, [OpenAI o1-preview](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/) and [OpenAI o1-mini](https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-reasoning/), representing a significant step forward in large language models (LLMs). These models are being hailed as the first commercial implementations of "[System 2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.06023v1)" reasoning models, a concept that contrasts with the traditional "System 1" AI models we've been using since the release of ChatGPT in 2022. But what exactly is a System 2 model, and how does it differ from System 1? This article dives into the techniques, concepts, and innovations behind this new wave of reasoning-based [AI](https://www.spheron.network/).

## **What Is the System 2 Model?**

The idea of System 1 and System 2 thinking originates from [Daniel Kahneman's 2011 book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*.](https://www.amazon.in/Thinking-Fast-Penguin-Press-Non-Fiction/dp/0141033576) System 1 refers to fast, intuitive thinking, while System 2 involves slower, more deliberate, and analytical thinking. Similarly, in AI, System 1 models respond quickly to prompts based on learned patterns, whereas System 2 models engage in more thoughtful, step-by-step reasoning.

Until now, most of the AI models we have interacted with fall into the System 1 category, offering immediate responses based on previous training. System 2 models, like the new OpenAI o1, are designed to break down complex tasks, analyze different scenarios, and deliver more reasoned responses—mimicking a more human-like reasoning process.

## **The Shift from System 1 to System 2 in AI**

When OpenAI launched [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) in November 2022, it quickly became clear that AI models could handle a wide variety of tasks but often struggled with more complex, multi-step problems. System 1 models are excellent for straightforward queries, but tasks that require deeper analysis have often been challenging.

System 2 models, by contrast, approach problems methodically. They break tasks into smaller steps, assess different approaches, and evaluate outcomes before delivering a final response. This transition from reactive to deliberate problem-solving can revolutionize how AI handles more nuanced, never-before-seen problems.

## **Key Concepts Behind System 2 Models**

### **1\. Chain of Thought (CoT) Reasoning**

The foundation of System 2 models lies in their ability to use [**Chain of Thought (CoT)** reasoning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/chain-of-thoughts). This involves generating intermediate steps before arriving at a final answer, helping the model process complex problems more effectively. This approach, popularized by papers such as *Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models* (2022), allows the model to reason through a problem, much like a human would break down a difficult question.

### **2\. Tree of Thoughts**

Another technique integrated into System 2 models is the [**Tree of Thoughts** (2023)](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/tot). This method expands on the CoT approach by exploring multiple paths of reasoning simultaneously. The model can evaluate different strategies in parallel, selecting the most promising path based on logical outcomes.

### **3\. Branch-Solve-Merge (BSM)**

A more recent innovation is the [**Branch-Solve-Merge** (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15123) technique. This allows the model to branch off into different potential solutions, work through each one, and then merge the best elements to form a final, optimized solution.

### **4\. System 2 Attention**

System 2 Attention is another key aspect of these models. While traditional models use attention mechanisms to focus on important words or tokens in a prompt, System 2 models pay attention to the most critical steps in a reasoning process. By weighing certain reasoning paths more heavily, these models can make more informed decisions throughout the problem-solving process.

## **What Are Reasoning Tokens?**

One of the biggest breakthroughs in System 2 models is the introduction of **reasoning tokens**. These tokens serve as a guide for the AI, directing it through each step of the reasoning process. Rather than simply responding to a prompt, the model uses these tokens to think through a problem more thoroughly.

## **Types of Reasoning Tokens**

There are several types of reasoning tokens used in System 2 models, each designed for a specific purpose:

* **Self-Reasoning Tokens**: These tokens help the model reason about the problem by itself, almost like a self-guided brainstorming session.
    
* **Planning Tokens**: These tokens help the model plan out its steps in advance, ensuring that it follows a logical path toward solving the problem.
    

Examples of reasoning tokens might include commands like `<Analyze_Problem>`, `<Generate_Hypothesis>`, `<Evaluate_Evidence>`, and `<Draw_Conclusion>`. These tokens are invisible to the user but are crucial in guiding the AI through a complex reasoning process.

## **Intermediate Reasoning Outputs**

System 2 models often generate **intermediate outputs** or temporary conclusions during reasoning. These outputs allow the model to assess its progress before giving a final answer. However, these intermediate steps are removed before the user sees the final output. This behind-the-scenes reasoning process makes System 2 models capable of solving more intricate problems than their System 1 predecessors.

## **The Role of Reinforcement Learning (RL)**

OpenAI has also integrated [**Reinforcement Learning (RL)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-reinforcement-learning/) into its System 2 models. RL helps the model focus on the most promising reasoning paths while avoiding less fruitful ones. By continuously learning from its mistakes, the model improves over time, improving at solving complex problems with each iteration.

This learning mechanism allows the AI to excel at tasks involving uncertainty or long-term planning—areas where traditional models tend to falter. RL ensures that the model doesn’t waste resources exploring unproductive paths and instead zeroes in on the best solutions faster.

## **Decision Gates: Ensuring Thoughtful Responses**

System 2 models also use **Decision Gates**, which act as checkpoints during the reasoning process. These gates determine whether the model has engaged in sufficient reasoning before responding. If the reasoning is incomplete, the model continues to process the task until a satisfactory solution is found.

## **How System 2 Models Excel at Complex Tasks**

Thanks to their CoT reasoning, planning tokens, and reinforcement learning techniques, System 2 models are particularly well-suited for complex, never-seen-before tasks. For example, deciphering ancient texts or installing a Wi-Fi network in a large stadium can be broken down into manageable steps by using specialized reasoning tokens.

## **Example: Deciphering Corrupted Texts**

In a scenario where a System 2 model is tasked with deciphering a corrupted text, the reasoning tokens might include:

* `<analyze_script>`: Directs the model to analyze the text’s structure.
    
* `<identify_patterns>`: Guides the model in looking for recurring themes or patterns.
    
* `<cross_reference>`: Prompts the model to compare the corrupted text with known texts.
    

These tokens help the model approach the task step-by-step, just as a human expert would.

## **System 2 in Action: Complex Wi-Fi Installations**

Similarly, when designing a Wi-Fi installation in a complex environment like a stadium, the model could use tokens like:

* `<Analyze_Environment>`: To understand the stadium’s layout.
    
* `<Determine_AP_Locations>`: To decide the best places to install access points.
    
* `<Simulate_Traffic>`: To simulate a full stadium and assess Wi-Fi performance.
    

By simulating different scenarios and solutions, the model ensures that the final outcome is optimized for real-world conditions.

## **Conclusion: The Future of AI with System 2 Models**

System 2 models represent a major leap forward in AI capabilities, offering a new level of reasoning and problem-solving that traditional models couldn’t achieve. These models can tackle more complex, multi-step tasks with greater accuracy by utilizing techniques like Chain of Thought reasoning, reinforcement learning, and planning tokens. Although System 2 AI is still evolving, its potential to reshape industries like engineering, science, and data analysis is undeniable.
