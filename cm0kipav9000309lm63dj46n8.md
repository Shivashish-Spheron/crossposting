## [**1\. Introductio**](https://www.youtube.com/@SpheronFDN)**n to Kaisar Network: Pioneering Decentralized GPU Networks**

**Prakarsh:** Hey Leonie, it’s great to have you here! Let’s kick things off with a bit about Kaisar Network. I’ve been following your work closely, and it’s amazing how you’ve been shaping the decentralized GPU landscape. Can you tell us more about your journey and what you’ve been building?

**Leonie:** Thanks, Prakarsh! It’s great to be here. I’m Leonie, co-founder of Kaisar Network. We started our journey in 2016 and have been deeply involved in the compute space ever since. Recently, we’ve been focused on building a decentralized GPU network that connects GPU providers with enterprises, AI developers, and researchers who need access to compute power. We aim to make these resources more accessible and cost-effective by decentralizing how they are distributed.

## **2\. Why Decentralize GPUs? Understanding the Necessity**

**Prakarsh:** The idea of decentralizing GPUs is really intriguing. But let’s get to the core of it—why is decentralization so necessary in the first place?

**Leonie:** Great question! The biggest issue with centralized GPU providers like AWS or Google Cloud is the high cost and limited accessibility. These barriers slow down advancements in tech fields like AI, gaming, and scientific research. By decentralizing GPUs, we can distribute computational resources globally, training AI models using data localized in different regions, and thus reducing costs and enhancing efficiency. It’s not just about decentralization; it’s about democratization—making compute power accessible to all.

## **3\. The Democratization of Compute: Accessibility for Everyone**

**Prakarsh:** Absolutely, democratization is key. Today, starting even a small AI project can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars just for the computational resources. This really limits innovation, especially for startups and researchers.

**Leonie:** Exactly! Decentralizing GPUs allows us to break down these financial and logistical barriers. With platforms like Kaer and Speron, we’re not just providing resources; we’re making compute power available to anyone, anywhere. It’s about giving everyone—from large enterprises to individual researchers—the tools they need without the prohibitive costs.

## **4\. Overcoming Compliance Challenges in Decentralized Compute**

**Prakarsh:** One big challenge, though, is compliance. Big companies usually turn to established players like AWS because they’re compliant with industry standards. How does a decentralized network tackle these concerns?

**Leonie:** That’s a really good point. The legacy players have built trust over decades, and that’s not easy to overcome. Our approach at Kaer is to start by building trust with companies we already have relationships with from our web2 days. We work closely with them, show them the cost benefits and operational efficiencies of decentralized compute, and help them transition gradually. Once they see the value, they can become champions of this new model, encouraging their partners and startups in their ecosystem to make the switch.

## **5\. Bridging the Trust Gap Between Web2 and Web3**

**Prakarsh:** It’s all about trust-building, isn’t it? Web3 apps often face skepticism, especially from traditional companies that are used to the reliability and compliance of web2 solutions.

**Leonie:** Exactly. Trust is a huge part of the equation. For Kaer, it’s not just about offering decentralized compute but also proving that it’s reliable, secure, and compliant. We’re constantly engaging with the community, educating them about the benefits and real-world use cases of decentralized networks, and showcasing how we match or even exceed the service quality of traditional providers.

## **6\. The Reality of Decentralized Compute: AWS and GCP in the Mix?**

**Prakarsh:** There’s also a common misconception that many so-called decentralized networks are still using AWS or GCP on the backend. How do you see this playing out in the industry?

**Leonie:** That’s a reality we’re aware of, and it’s an unfortunate one. While some projects claim to be fully decentralized, they still rely on centralized cloud services for parts of their operations. At Kaer, we’ve made a conscious decision to avoid this pitfall. We’re committed to true decentralization—building on a robust, transparent system that doesn’t rely on centralized cloud giants. It’s challenging, but it’s the only way to genuinely deliver on the promise of decentralization.

## **7\. Moving Beyond the Buzzwords: Real Applications of Decentralized Compute**

**Prakarsh:** I completely agree. It’s all about walking the talk. But let’s talk about real applications. How do you see decentralized GPU networks like Kaer and Speron pushing the boundaries of AI and other technologies?

**Leonie:** The applications are vast! From training AI models using geographically distributed GPUs to running private AI agents in the spatial web, the possibilities are endless. We’re even exploring use cases in the development of AI-driven tools in new environments, like the emerging spatial web, which many know as the metaverse’s evolution. Decentralized compute can fundamentally reshape how these advanced technologies are developed and deployed.

## **8\. The Big Players: AWS, GCP vs. Decentralized Networks**

**Prakarsh:** That’s exciting! But when we talk about AWS, GCP, and other traditional giants, what do you think sets decentralized platforms like Kaer and Speron apart?

**Leonie:** The main differences lie in transparency, cost, and flexibility. Traditional cloud providers are expensive and operate on a closed, centralized model. In contrast, decentralized networks offer a transparent, community-driven approach with lower costs and more composability. Users have greater control over their resources, and providers are directly incentivized, creating a fairer and more sustainable ecosystem.

## **9\. Composability and Flexibility: The Key to Decentralized Compute**

**Prakarsh:** I think composability is a game-changer. For instance, with Speron’s Fiz nodes, users can easily connect their own machines to the network and start providing compute. It’s about making the entire ecosystem more accessible and user-driven.

**Leonie:** Absolutely. It’s about building a network that’s open, transparent, and adaptable to user needs. We want providers to feel valued and users to have seamless access to compute resources without all the red tape and costs associated with centralized systems.

## **10\. The Advantage of Building on Specific Layer-One Networks**

**Prakarsh:** Speaking of networks, Kaer is built on Peak, and Speron on Arbitrum. What led Kaer to choose Peak, and what advantages does it offer?

**Leonie:** We initially considered building our own Layer 1, but Peak Network offered us the perfect blend of customization and support. Peak has an entire ecosystem of decentralized physical infrastructure projects, which aligns perfectly with what we’re building at Kaer. Being part of this ecosystem allows us to collaborate easily with other projects, share resources, and innovate faster.

## **11\. Major Partnerships: Nvidia and TikTok**

**Prakarsh:** I saw that you’ve partnered with big names like Nvidia and TikTok. Can you share more about these collaborations?

**Leonie:** Sure! We’re part of Nvidia’s Inception program, which supports startups pushing the boundaries of AI. Our partnership with TikTok is particularly exciting—they’re on the demand side, utilizing our compute resources. These partnerships validate our approach and help us expand our impact across industries.

## **12\. The Future of Decentralized Compute: What’s Next?**

**Prakarsh:** Looking ahead, where do you see Kaisar Network in the next two to three years? What’s your vision for the future?

**Leonie:** We see ourselves continuing to evolve in the GPU space, but we’re also looking at new frontiers like edge computing and private inferencing. Compute is the currency of the future, especially as AI advances. We plan to stay ahead by developing new products that leverage GPUs in innovative ways, keeping us at the forefront of technological evolution.

## **13\. The Role of Collaboration in Building the Future**

**Prakarsh:** Collaboration seems to be the lifeblood of web3. How do you see Kaer and Speron working together in the long term?

**Leonie:** Collaboration is everything. There’s more demand for compute than any one network can supply, so working together is essential. We’re excited to leverage Speron’s network, especially in regions we don’t cover, like India. Together, we can create a massive pool of resources that will drive innovation across multiple sectors.

## **14\. AI, GPUs, and Beyond: The Future of Compute**

**Prakarsh:** Finally, when we talk about “AI, GPUs, and Beyond,” what does that “beyond” mean to you? What’s your vision for the next decade?

**Leonie:** For me, “beyond” means pushing into new paradigms of compute—things like private inferencing on personal devices, universal basic compute, and AI agents in the spatial web. Imagine a future where everyone can monetize their compute power, training AI models privately on their own devices. This is the kind of future we’re building towards, where technology is decentralized, democratized, and directly accessible to everyone.
