The rapid rise of artificial intelligence ([AI](https://www.spheron.network/)) is reshaping industries and job markets worldwide, making reskilling and upskilling more critical than ever. Organizations are grappling with the need to adapt to this AI-driven transformation from the boardroom to the classroom. To help you navigate this complex landscape, we’ve analyzed five leading reports on AI reskilling, so you don’t have to.

These reports offer a comprehensive look at the current state of AI-related skills; the challenges companies face in reskilling their workforce, and the strategic importance of adapting to this new reality. Let’s dive into the key takeaways from these reports and explore how they can help guide your strategy for staying competitive in the age of AI.

## **1.** [**Reskilling in the Age of AI — Harvard Business Review**](https://hbr.org/2023/09/reskilling-in-the-age-of-ai)

Harvard Business Review (HBR) emphasizes the urgency of reskilling in the age of AI, highlighting that companies must move beyond traditional training approaches. The report argues that businesses need to rethink their talent strategies, focusing on continuous learning and flexible skill development to keep pace with technological advancements.

Advancements in technology, especially AI, are rapidly transforming jobs. The **OECD** predicted that automation could eliminate 14% of global jobs and significantly change 32%. With many knowledge-based roles now vulnerable to automation, workers need to reskill to stay relevant.

As new technologies emerge, many jobs become outdated, and skills have a shorter lifespan, especially in tech fields. Companies must invest in reskilling to fill critical skill gaps and stay competitive. Simply upskilling isn’t enough—workers need new capabilities for future roles.

### The Path Forward:

The article identifies **five key shifts** companies need to embrace for successful reskilling:

1. **Make Reskilling a Strategic Priority:** Companies like Amazon, Vodafone, and Infosys recognize that reskilling helps them stay ahead. They focus on developing in-house talent quickly to fill roles that are hard to source externally.
    
2. **Engage Leadership:** Reskilling efforts must involve all leaders, not just HR. Organizations like Ericsson and CVS ensure top management connects reskilling to the company’s goals, making it a priority across all departments.
    
3. **Treat Reskilling as a Change-Management Process:** Companies must understand skill needs, shift employee mindsets, and support on-the-job learning. This approach helps organizations like Wipro and Novartis integrate reskilled employees more effectively.
    
4. **Get Employees on Board:** Workers are more willing to reskill when they see clear benefits. Companies like Bosch and Vodafone offer time and financial support, encouraging employees to take part in reskilling programs.
    
5. **Build Partnerships:** Reskilling doesn’t happen in isolation. Companies should partner with governments, nonprofits, and educational institutions to access diverse talent pools and scale reskilling efforts. Programs like the **Technology in Finance Immersion Programme** in Singapore show how industry-wide collaborations can meet future skill demands.
    

**What This Means for You**: Companies must focus on reskilling as a strategic initiative to succeed in an AI-driven world. By engaging leaders, building partnerships, and aligning reskilling with company goals, organizations can adapt to technological changes and ensure their workforce stays relevant.

## **2.** [**Your Strategy Is Only as Good as Your Skills — BCG**](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/your-strategy-is-only-as-good-as-your-skills)

The BCG report "Your Strategy Is Only as Good as Your Skills" stresses the importance of skill development in corporate strategy. Despite its significance, many companies still treat skill-building as an HR task and report on it in limited ways, focusing more on processes than outcomes. Only a small percentage of firms link skill development to their business strategy, and even fewer report the impact of these efforts on productivity or employee growth.

Skill building is often viewed as a cost rather than a strategic investment, making it one of the first areas to face cuts during financial pressures. However, companies that embrace skill development as a priority, like Allianz and Bosch, show that aligning learning initiatives with business goals can future-proof their workforce.

The report highlights the importance of focusing on measurable outcomes, inspiring leadership involvement in learning, and creating a culture where skills are continuously developed and valued. Ultimately, companies that treat human capital investments with the same rigor as financial assets will be better positioned for success in the fast-evolving business landscape.

### Key Insights:

* **Lack of Focus on Skill Building:** About 20% of companies do not prioritize learning or skill building in their reports. Even when mentioned, it often appears as a generic part of HR or corporate social responsibility without any depth. The emphasis on skill development today mirrors how companies approached diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) 15 years ago—something that's now a core focus with dedicated reporting.
    
* **Skill Development Not Integrated with Strategy:** Many companies view skill development as an HR initiative rather than an integral part of corporate strategy. Less than 15% of business leaders believe learning is crucial for their company’s strategy. Only a few firms forecast skill gaps based on their business needs, and only 24% connect skill-building efforts to strategic priorities.
    
* **Lack of Reporting on Skill Outcomes:** Companies frequently focus on reporting the number of training hours and certifications but rarely on outcomes like productivity improvements or employee development. Only 4% of companies report skill-building outcomes that tie back to business or talent metrics.
    
* **Skill Building Seen as a Cost, Not an Investment:** Most companies view skill development as an expense rather than an investment in future capabilities. Learning budgets are often the first to be cut during cost pressures, undermining long-term business performance. Even though companies spend significant amounts on skill development (up to $400 million), this investment is undervalued and deprioritized.
    
* **Reframing Skill Building as Strategic:** Companies need to recognize skill building as a strategic priority, aligning it closely with business objectives. Companies like Allianz and Bosch are setting examples by tying skill development directly to digitalization and future workforce needs.
    
* **Measuring Skill Outcomes:** Publicly reporting on business and talent outcomes, rather than just training hours, can drive greater impact. For example, AT&T's Real-Time Training program has demonstrated measurable business improvements, such as increased revenue and customer acquisition.
    
* **Cultural Shift and Leadership Buy-In:** Leaders must champion skill development, showcase their learning experiences, and promote a lifelong learning culture. Encouraging skills development regularly in team meetings or new projects can create a culture of continuous improvement.
    
* **Future of Skill Building:** The need for a skilled workforce will only grow, and companies prioritizing skill development and tracking its progress like any other asset will have a competitive advantage.
    

**What This Means for You**: Align your reskilling efforts with your strategic goals. Conduct regular skills audits to identify gaps and invest in targeted reskilling to ensure your workforce is equipped to execute your strategy effectively.

The "AI Skills Report 2024" highlights the rapid growth of AI adoption across industries, with most organizations investing in AI to improve efficiency and customer experience. However, there is a significant gap between AI investments and workforce readiness. Many IT professionals feel unprepared to use AI tools effectively, and most companies lack formal training programs to address this skills gap.

The report emphasizes the importance of upskilling and continuous learning for successful AI implementation and the need for organizations to overcome barriers like budget constraints and reliance on outsourcing AI talent. A comprehensive AI upskilling strategy is crucial for long-term success in leveraging AI technologies.
