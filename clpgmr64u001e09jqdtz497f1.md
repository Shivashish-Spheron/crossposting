## What's Cooking?

Hey there! You've probably heard whispers about our new baby, [Spheron GPU](https://spheron.network), right? It's been a few weeks since we launched this feature, and honestly, it's so much more than just another GPU solution. Imagine a world where GPUs from all over the planet come together, ready to power your AI containers and Jupyter notebooks to help you build better AI products. Sounds cool, right?

## Why Spheron GPU? Let's Chat!

So, We had this enlightening chat with some AI founders in San Francisco. Here's the scoop: most AI infrastructure is chained to the big guys – [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en), and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in). But, man, the costs! Startups are bleeding cash training models. That's where we step in with Spheron – think of it as your AI project's new best friend.

## Our Vision - More Than Just Words

We've always dreamed big at Spheron. Our goal? To bundle up all this awesome infrastructure to give you something that's not just reliable and secure, but also easy on your wallet. And guess what? We're now diving headfirst into AI infrastructure. Why not bring together GPUs from across the globe? That's the kind of crazy we love!
