0G is a transformative blockchain infrastructure project that facilitates high-performance applications such as on-chain AI, gaming, and decentralized finance (DeFi) through an advanced data availability and decentralized storage system. By providing a scalable, secure, and efficient platform, it seeks to address some of the most pressing challenges in the blockchain space, including scalability, data processing speeds, and interoperability.

The goal of 0G is to democratize access to blockchain technology and enable the development of applications that were previously not feasible due to technological constraints, thus bridging the gap between Web3 capabilities and Web2 performance standards.

## Origin Story

[0G Labs](https://0g.ai/) was founded to address the limitations of existing blockchain data storage and availability solutions. The founders recognized that as blockchain adoption grew, so did the need for efficient and scalable data solutions. Traditional blockchains struggled with data storage and throughput, leading to high costs and inefficiencies. 0G Labs' mission is to create an infinitely scalable data layer that can handle the increasing data demands of modern blockchain applications.

## **0G’s Architecture**

0G’s high scalability hinges on separating the data availability workflow into:

**a) The Data Storage Lane**: This lane achieves horizontal scalability through well-designed data partitioning for large data transfers. Significant data can be stored or accessed nearly instantaneously.

**b) The Data Publishing Lane**: Guarantees data availability using a quorum-based system that assumes an “honest majority,” with the quorum randomly selected via VRF. This only takes up a tiny flow of data and avoids any data broadcasting bottlenecks, allowing space for the larger Data Storage Lane transfers.

“0G Storage” is 0G’s on-chain database comprising a network of Storage Nodes actively participating in a PoW-like mining process known as Proof of Random Access (PoRA). PoRA requires miners to correctly answer random queries relating to archived data, with the corresponding Storage Node rewarded accordingly. 0G focuses on rewarding nodes for their contributions rather than punishing them for misbehavior to encourage network participation in network maintenance and improve scalability.

“0G DA” is 0G’s infinitely scalable DA Layer directly built on top of 0G Storage. A quorum-based architecture provides DA confirmation using an “honest majority assumption” whereby nodes agree on available data. A VRF is used to randomize the quorum, while GPUs accelerate the erasure coding process needed to store data properly.

## **What Does 0G Solve?**

The need for greater Layer 2 (L2) scalability has directly coincided with the recent rise of DA Layers, with L2s widely agreed upon as the solution to Ethereum’s scaling woes. L2s conduct transactions off-chain and settle on Ethereum for security purposes, meaning that they must post the actual transaction data somewhere so that it may be confirmed as valid. Publishing data onto Ethereum directly spreads its high fees amongst L2 users, increasing scalability.

DALs provide a more efficient means of publishing off-chain data and keeping it available for anyone to inspect.

That being said, existing DALs are inadequate for supporting the exponentially increasing amount of data arriving on-chain. They cannot store vast sums of data and have limited throughput, which is especially concerning for data-intense use cases like on-chain AI.

0G provides a 1,000x performance improvement over Ethereum’s [danksharding](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/danksharding/) and a 4x improvement over Solana’s [Firedancer](https://solana.com/ecosystem/firedancer), providing the necessary infrastructure to massively scale Web3’s data needs. AI is a significant focus, as 0G Storage can store vast datasets while using 0G DA to quickly create AI models on-chain.

Beyond this, other use cases include:

## **0G Labs Use Cases**

**a) L1s / L2s**: These parties may use 0G’s AI models or 0G for data availability and storage. Partners include Polygon, Arbitrum, Fuel, Manta Network, and more.

**b) Bridges**: Given that networks can easily store their state using 0G, state migration is possible between networks, facilitating secure cross-chain transfers. For example, relevant user balances can be stored as data and communicated cross-chain for fast, accurate transfers.

**c) Rollups-as-a-Service (RaaS)**: a DA option and data storage infrastructure for RaaS providers like Caldera and AltLayer.

**d) DeFi**: 0G’s quick and scalable DA may support highly efficient DeFi on specific L2s & L3s due to fast settlement and storage, such as high-frequency trading.

**e) On-chain Gaming**: Gaming requires vast amounts of cryptographic proof-related data that need to be reliably stored on top of all regular metadata, such as a given player’s assets, points, actions, and more.

**f) Data Markets**: It makes the most sense that Web3 data markets truly store their data on-chain, which is currently only feasible on a large scale using 0G.

0G is the scalable, low-cost, and fully programmable DA solution necessary to truly bring vast amounts of data on-chain. This would not be possible without 0G’s complementary role as an on-chain data storage solution, which unlocks even more use cases (such as providing database infrastructure for any on-chain application).

0G can store any type of Web2 or Web3 data while efficiently proving its data availability. The benefit of this extends far beyond confirming Layer 2 transactions, as any data (large-scale datasets, a blockchain’s state, crypto.
